At Strawberry Hill. I went. How long I stayed,<br />
Urged by dear friends and the restoring breeze,<br />
Let me not say; long enough to complete<br />
My rhythmic structure; day by day it grew,<br />
And all sweet influences helped its growth.<br />
The lawn sloped green and ample till the trees<br />
Met on its margin; and the Hudson's tide<br />
Rolled beautiful beyond, where purple gleams<br />
Fell on the Palisades or touched the hills<br />
Of the opposing shore; for all without<br />
Was but an emblem of the symmetry<br />
I found within, where love held perfect sway,<br />
With taste and beauty and domestic peace<br />

And, like the sun, make the clod burst in bloom,&mdash;<br />
Unseal the fount so mute this many a day,<br />
And help me sing of Linda! Why of her,<br />
Since she would shrink with manifest recoil,<br />
Knew she that deeds of hers were made a theme<br />
For measured verse? Why leave the garden flowers<br />
To fix the eye on one poor violet<br />
That on the solitary grove sheds fragrance?<br />
Themes are enough, that court a wide regard,<br />
And prompt a strenuous flight; and yet from all,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
My thoughts come back to Linda. Let me spare,<br />
As best I may, her modest privacy,<br />
While under Fancy's not inapt disguise<br />
I give substantial truth, and deal with no<br />
Unreal beings or fantastic facts:<br />
Bear witness to it, Linda!

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Now while May</span><br />
Keeps me a restive prisoner in the house,<br />
For the first time the Spring's unkindness ever<br />
Held me aloof from her companionship,<br />
However roughly from the east her breath<br />
Came as if all the icebergs of Grand Bank<br />
Were giving up their forms in that one gust,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Now while on orchard-trees the struggling blossoms<br />
Break from the varnished cerements, and in clouds<br />
Of pink and white float round the boughs that hold<br />
Their verdure yet in check,&mdash;and while the lawn<br />
Lures from yon hemlock hedge the robin, plump<br />
And copper-breasted, and the west wind brings<br />
Mildness and balm,&mdash;let me attempt the task<br />
That also is a pastime.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">What though Spring</span><br />
Brings not of Youth the wonder and the zest;<br />
The hopes, the day-dreams, and the exultations?<br />
The animal life whose overflow and waste<br />
Would far out-measure now our little hoard?<br />
The health that made mere physical existence<br />
An ample joy; that on the ocean beach<br />
Shared with the leaping waves their breezy glee;<br />
That in deep woods, or in forsaken clearings,<br />
Where the charred logs were hid by verdure new,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
And the shy wood-thrush lighted; or on hills<br />
Whence counties lay outspread beneath our gaze;<br />
Or by some rock-girt lake where sandy margins<br />
Sloped to the mirrored tints of waving trees,&mdash;<br />
Could feel no burden in the grasshopper,<br />
And no unrest in the long summer day?<br />
Would I esteem Youth's fervors fair return<br />
For temperate airs that fan sublimer heights<br />
Than Youth could scale; heights whence the patient vision<br />
May see this life's harsh inequalities,<br />
Its rudimental good and full-blown evil,<br />
Its crimes and earthquakes and insanities,<br />
And all the wrongs and sorrows that perplex us,<br />
Assume, beneath the eternal calm, the order<br />
Which can come only from a Love Divine?<br />
A love that sees the good beyond the evil,<br />
The serial life beyond the eclipsing death,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
That tracks the spirit through eternities,<br />
Backward and forward, and in every germ<br />
Beholds its past, its present, and its future,<br />
At every stage beholds it gravitate<br />
Where it belongs, and thence new-born emerge<br />
Into new life and opportunity,<br />
An outcast never from the assiduous Mercy,<br />
Providing for His teeming universe,<br />
Divinely perfect not because complete,<br />
But because incomplete, advancing ever<br />
Beneath the care Supreme?&mdash;heights whence the soul,<br />
Uplifted from all speculative fog,<br />
All darkening doctrine, all confusing fear,<br />
Can see the drifted plants, can scent the odors,<br />
That surely come from that celestial shore<br />
To which we tend; however out of reckoning,<br />
Swept wrong by Error's currents, Passion's storms,<br />
The poor tossed bark may be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&nbsp;Descend, my thoughts!</span><br />
Your theme lies lowly as the ground-bird's nest;<br />
Why seek, with wings so feeble and unused,<br />
To soar above the clouds and front the stars?<br />
Descend from your high venture, and to scenes<br />
Of the heart's common history come down!<br />

<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> little mansion had its fill of sunshine;<br />
The western windows overlooked the Hudson<br />
Where the great city's traffic vexed the tide;<br />
The front received the Orient's early flush.<br />
Here dwelt three beings, who the neighbors said<br />
Were husband, wife, and daughter; and indeed<br />
There was no sign that they were otherwise.<br />
Their name was Percival; they lived secluded,<br />
Saw no society, except some poor<br />
Old pensioner who came for food or help;<br />
Though, when fair days invited, they would take<br />
The omnibus and go to see the paintings<br />
At the Academy; or hear the music<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
At opera or concert; then, in summer,<br />
A visit to the seaside or the hills<br />
Would oft entice them.<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Percival had reached</span><br />
His threescore years and five, but stood erect<br />
As if no touch of age had chilled him yet.<br />
Simple in habit, studious how to live<br />
In best conformity with laws divine,&mdash;<br />
Impulsive, yet by trial taught to question<br />
All impulses, affections, appetites,<br />
At Reason's bar,&mdash;two objects paramount<br />
Seemed steadily before him; one, to find<br />
The eternal truth, showing the constant right<br />
In politics, in social life, in morals,&mdash;<br />
The other, to apply all love and wisdom<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
To education of his child&mdash;of Linda.
</div>
<div class="poem">
Yet, if with eye anointed, you could look<br />
On that benign and tranquil countenance,<br />
You might detect the lines which Passion leaves<br />
Long after its volcano is extinct<br />
And flowers conceal its lava. Percival<br />
Was older than his consort, twenty years;<br />
Yet were they fitly mated; though, with her,<br />
Time had dealt very gently, leaving face<br />
And rounded form still youthful, and unmarred<br />
By one uncomely outline; hardly mingling<br />
A thread of silver in her chestnut hair<br />
That affluent needed no deceiving braid.<br />
Framed for maternity the matron seemed:<br />
Thrice had she been a mother; but the children,<br />
The first six winters of her union brought,<br />
A boy and girl, were lost to her at once<br />
By a wall's falling on them, as they went,<br />
Heedless of danger, hand in hand, to school.<br />
To either parent terrible the blow!<br />
But, three years afterward, when Linda came,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
With her dark azure eyes and golden hair,<br />
It was as if a healing angel touched<br />
The parents' wound, and turned their desolation<br />
Into a present paradise, revealing<br />
Two dear ones, beckoning from the spirit-land,<br />
And one, detaining them, with infant grasp,<br />
Feeble, yet how resistless! here below.<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
And so there was great comfort in that household:<br />
And those unwhispered longings both had felt<br />
At times, that they might pass to other scenes<br />
Where Love would find its own, were felt no more:<br />
For Linda grew in beauty every day;<br />
Beauty not only of the outward mould,<br />
Sparkling in those dear eyes, and on the wind<br />
Tossing those locks of gold, but beauty born,<br />
In revelations flitting o'er the face,<br />
From the soul's inner symmetry; from love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><br />
Too deep and pure to utter, had she words;<br />
From the divine desire to know; to prove<br />
All objects brought within her dawning ken;<br />
From frolic mirth, not heedless but most apt;<br />
From sense of conscience, shown in little things<br />
So early; and from infant courtesy<br />
Charming and debonair.
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The parents said,</span><br />
While the glad tears shone brimming in their eyes,<br />
"Oh! lacking love and best experience<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
Are those who tell us that the purity<br />
And innocence of childhood are delusion;<br />
Or that, so far as they exist, they show<br />
The absence of all mind; no impulses<br />
Save those of selfish passion moving it!<br />
And that, by nature desperately wicked,<br />
The child learns good through evil; having no<br />
Innate ideas, no inborn will, no bias.<br />
Here, in this infant, is our confutation!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><br />
O self-sufficing physiologist,<br />
Who, grubbing in the earth, hast missed the stars,<br />
We ask no other answer to thy creed<br />
Than this, the answer heaven and earth supply."<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
Now sixteen summers had our Linda seen,<br />
And grown to be a fair-haired, winsome maid,<br />
In shape and aspect promising to be<br />
A softened repetition of her mother;<br />
And yet some traits from the paternal side<br />
Gave to the head an intellectual grace<br />
And to the liquid eyes a power reserved,<br />
Brooding awhile in tender gloom, and then<br />
Flashing emotion, as some lofty thought,<br />
Some sight of pity, or some generous deed,<br />
Kindled a ready sympathy whose tears<br />
Fell on no barren purpose; for with Linda<br />
To feel, to be uplifted, was to act;<br />
Her sorest trials being when she found<br />
How far the wish to do outran the power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br />
Often would Percival observe his child,<br />
And study to divine if in the future<br />
Of that organization, when mature,<br />
There should prevail the elements that lead<br />
Woman to find the crowning charm of life<br />
In the affections of a happy marriage,<br />
Or if with satisfactions of the mind<br />
And the &aelig;sthetic faculty, the aims<br />
Of art and letters, the pursuits of trade,<br />
Linda might find the fresh activities<br />
He craved for her, and which forecasting care<br />
Might possibly provide.<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">His means were small,</span><br />
Merged in a life-annuity which gave<br />
All that he held as indispensable<br />
To sanative conditions in a home:<br />
Good air, good influences, proper food.<br />
By making his old wardrobe do long service<br />
He saved the wherewith to get faithful help<br />
From the best teachers in instructing Linda;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />
And she was still the object uppermost.<br />
Dawned the day fair, for Linda it was fair,<br />
And they all three could ramble in the Park.<br />
If on Broadway the ripe fruit tempted him,<br />
Linda was fond of fruit; those grapes will do<br />
For Linda. Was the music rich and rare?<br />
Linda must hear it. Were the paintings grand?<br />
Linda must see them. So the important thought<br />
Was always Linda; and the mother shared<br />
In all this fond parental providence;<br />
For in her tender pride in the dear girl<br />
There was no room for any selfish thought,<br />
For any jealous balancing of dues.
</div>
<div class="poem">
"My child," said Percival, one summer day,<br />
As he brought in a bunch of snow-white roses,<br />
Ringed with carnations, many-leafed and fragrant,<br />
"Take it, an offering for your birthday; this<br />
Is June the twelfth, a happy day for me."<br />
"How fresh, how beautiful!" said Linda rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><br />
And kissing him on either cheek.  "Dear father,<br />
You spoil me for all other care, I fear,<br />
Since none can be like yours."<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Why speak of that?"</span><br />
He with a start exclaimed; "my care must be<br />
Prolonged till I can see you safely fixed<br />
In an assured and happy womanhood.<br />
Why should it not be so? Though sixty-five,<br />
How well am I, and strong! No, Linda, no;<br />
Dream not of other tendance yet awhile;<br />
My father lived to eighty, and his father<br />
To eighty-five; and I am stronger now<br />
Than they were, at my age."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Live long!" cried Linda,</span><br />
"For whom have I to love me, to befriend,<br />
You and my mother gone?"
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Your mother, child?</span><br />
She should outlive me by some twenty years<br />
At least. God grant, her sweet companionship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
May be your strength and light when I'm not here,<br />
My matchless little girl, my precious Linda!"
</div>
<div class="poem">
"Ah! how Love magnifies the thing it loves!"<br />
Smiling she said: "when I look in the glass,<br />
I see a comely Miss; nay, perhaps pretty;<br />
That epithet is her superlative,<br />
So far as person is concerned, I fear.<br />
Grant her a cheerful temper; that she gets<br />
From both her parents. She is dutiful,&mdash;<br />
No wonder, for she never is opposed!<br />
Strangely coincident her way is yours;<br />
Industrious, but that's her mother's training.<br />
Then if you come to gifts of mind&mdash;ah me!<br />
What can she show? We'll not pronounce her dull;<br />
But she's not apt or quick; and all she gets<br />
Is by hard work, by oft-repeated trials,<br />
Trials with intermissions of despair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><br />
The languages she takes to not unkindly;<br />
But mathematics is her scourge, her kill-joy,<br />
Pressing her like a nightmare. Logic, too,<br />
Distresses and confuses her poor brain;<br />
Oh! ask her not for reasons. As for music&mdash;<br />
Music she loves. Would that Love might inspire<br />
The genius it reveres so ardently!<br />
Has she no gift for painting? Eye for form<br />
And coloring I truly think she has;<br />
And one thing she can do, and do it well;<br />
She can group flowers and ferns and autumn leaves,<br />
Paint their true tints, and render back to nature<br />
A not unfaithful copy.
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"This the extent</span><br />
Of her achievements! She has labored hard<br />
To mould a bust or statue; but the clay<br />
Lacked the Pygmalion touch beneath her hands.<br />
She'll never be a female Angelo.<br />
She must come down content to mother Earth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><br />
And study out the alphabet which Summer<br />
Weaves on the sod in fields or bordering woods.<br />
Such is your paragon, my simple father!<br />
But now, this ordinary little girl,<br />
So seeming frank, (whisper it low!) is yet<br />
So deep, so crafty, and so full of wiles,<br />
That she has quite persuaded both her parents&mdash;<br />
In most things sensible, clear-seeing people&mdash;<br />
That she is just a prodigy indeed!<br />
Not one of goodness merely, but of wit,<br />
Capacity, and general cleverness!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"There, that will do, spoilt darling! What a tongue!"<br />
Percival said, admiring while he chided.<br />
"O the swift time! Thou'rt seventeen to-day;<br />
And yet, except thy parents and thy teachers,<br />
Friends and companions thou hast hardly known.<br />
'Tis fit that I should tell thee why our life<br />
Has been thus socially estranged and quiet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><br />
Sit down, and let me push the arm-chair up<br />
Where I can note the changes in thy face;<br />
For 'tis a traitor, that sweet face of thine,<br />
And has a sign for every fleeting thought.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"But here's our little mother! Come, my dear,<br />
And take a seat by Linda; thou didst help me<br />
To graft upon the bitter past a fruit<br />
All sweetness, and thy very presence now<br />

The mother placed her hand upon his brow<br />
And said: "The water-lily springs from mud;<br />
So springs the future from the past." Then he:<br />
"My father's death made me, at twenty-one,<br />
Heir to a fortune which in those slow days<br />
Was thought sufficient: I had quitted Yale<br />
With some slight reputation as a scholar,<br />
And, in the first flush of ingenuous youth<br />
When brave imagination's rosy hue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><br />
Tinges all unknown objects, I was launched<br />
Into society in this great place;&mdash;<br />
Sisterless, motherless, and having seen<br />
But little, in my student life, of women.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"All matrons who had marriageable girls<br />
Looked on me as their proper prey, and spread<br />
Their nets to catch me; and, poor, verdant youth,<br />
Soon I was caught,&mdash;caught in a snare indeed,<br />
Though by no mother's clever management.<br />
Young, beautiful, accomplished, she, my Fate,<br />
Met me with smiles, and doomed me while she smiled<br />
Nimble as light, fluent as molten lead<br />
To take the offered mould,&mdash;apt to affect<br />
Each preference of taste or sentiment<br />
That best might flatter,&mdash;affable and kind,<br />
Or seeming so,&mdash;and generous to a fault,&mdash;<br />
But that was when she had a part to play,&mdash;<br />
Affectionate&mdash;ah! there too she was feigning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
As I look calmly back, to me she seems<br />
The simple incarnation of a mind<br />
Possessed of all the secrets of the heart,<br />
And quick to substitute a counterfeit<br />
For the heart's genuine coin, and make it pass;<br />
But void of feeling as the knife that wounds!<br />
And so the game was in her hands, and she<br />
Played it with confident, remorseless skill<br />
Even to the bitter end.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"Yet do not think</span><br />
The inner prescience never stirred or spoke:<br />
Veiled though it be from consciousness so strangely,<br />
And its fine voice unheard amid the din<br />
Of outward things, the quest of earthly passion,<br />
There is an under-sense, a faculty<br />
All independent of our mortal organs,<br />
And circumscribed by neither space nor time.<br />
Else whence proceed they, those clairvoyant glimpses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><br />
That vision piercing to the distant future,<br />
Those quick monitions of impending ruin,<br />
If not from depths of soul which consciousness,<br />
Limited as it is in mortal scope,<br />
May not explore? Yet there serenely latent,<br />
Or with a conscious being all their own,<br />
Superior and apart from what we know<br />
In this close keep we call our waking state,<br />
Lie growing with our growth the lofty powers<br />
We reck not of; which some may live a life<br />
And never heed, nor know they have a soul;<br />
Which many a plodding anthropologist,<br />
Philosopher, logician, scientist,<br />
Ignore as moonshine; but which are, no less,<br />
Actual, proven, and, in their dignity<br />
And grasp and space-defying attributes,<br />
Worthy to qualify a deathless spirit<br />
To have the range of an infinity<br />
Through an unending period&mdash;at once<br />

"One night, one mild, sweet night in early June,<br />
We two had paced the drawing-room together<br />
Till ten o'clock, and then I took my leave<br />
And walked along the street, a square or more,<br />
When suddenly I looked up at a star,<br />
And then, a thought I could not fail to heed,<br />
From the soul's awful region unexplored,<br />
Rushed, crying, 'Back! Go back!' And back I went,<br />
As hastily as if it were a thing<br />
Of life or death. I did not stop to pull<br />
The door-bell, but sprang up alert and still<br />
To the piazza of the open window,<br />
Drew back a blind inaudibly, looked in,<br />
And through the waving muslin curtain, saw&mdash;<br />
Well, she was seated in a young man's lap,<br />
Her head upon his shoulder.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Quick of ear</span><br />
As the chased hare, she heard me; started up,<br />
Ran to the curtain, eagerly drew me in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><br />
And said, while joy beamed tender in her eyes,<br />
'My brother Ambrose, just arrived from Europe!'<br />
So swift she was, she did not give me time<br />
Even for one jealous pang. I took his hand,<br />
And saying, 'Anna's brother must be mine,'<br />
I bade them both good-night, and went my way:<br />
So was I fooled,&mdash;my better angel baffled!
</div><div class="poem">
"And yet once more the vivid warning came,<br />
Flashed like quick truth from her own eyes. We stood<br />
Together in a ball-room, when a lady,<br />
To me unknown, came up, regarded me<br />
With strange compassion in her curious glance,<br />
And then, with something less divine than pity,<br />
Looked down on my betrothed, and moved away.<br />
I turned to Anna, but upon her face,<br />
There was a look to startle like a ghost;<br />
Defiance, deadly fear, and murderous hate<br />
Were all so wildly blended! But 'twas gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Gone like a flash before I well could mark it;<br />
And in its place there came a luminous smile,<br />
So childlike sweet, such type of heavenly candor,<br />
It would have served for a Madonna's mouth,<br />
To make the pilgrim's adoration easy.<br />
'Who was that lady, Anna?' I inquired.<br />
'A Mrs. Lothian,' was her reply:<br />
'A lovely person, although somewhat haughty.'<br />
We returned home soon after, and no more<br />
Was said of it.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"The rapid weeks flew by,</span><br />
And Anna plied her powers to charm, but still<br />
Not all the subtle glamour of her presence<br />
Could bind in sleep my pleading monitor.<br />
And so at last I said: 'We both are young:<br />
Let us, as earnest of a mutual wish<br />
To share a perfect love, or none at all,<br />
Absolve each other here, without condition,<br />
From this engagement; and, if three years hence<br />
We both are of one heart, then shall we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><br />
The means to make it known; of that be sure!<br />
Are you in your own loyalty so fixed<br />
As to accept the challenge? Would you prize<br />
The love of any man, who could not bear<br />
A test so simple?'
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"The first word I spoke</span><br />
Made all my meaning plain to her; she shook,<br />
But more perhaps with anger than with grief;<br />
She turned her face away, and covered it<br />
With both her hands, and so remained until<br />
I had done speaking; then she rose at once,<br />
Her face averted still, (she durst not show it!)<br />
And grasped my hand, and, in a husky tone<br />
Sheathing her wrath, exclaimed: 'To-morrow, come<br />
At twelve&mdash;at twelve!' and rushed out of the room.

"Prompt at the hour I went; and in the parlor<br />
Sat down expectant; and she entered soon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><br />
Clad all in white; upon her face the marks<br />
Of passionate tears, and a beseeching sorrow<br />
In every look! A desk of ivory,<br />
Borne in her hands, she placed upon the table;<br />
I rose to meet her, but she motioned me<br />
To keep my seat; then, with an arm thrown over<br />
A high-backed chair, as if to keep from falling,<br />
(The attitude was charming, and she knew it),<br />
She said: 'Take back the little desk you gave me;<br />
In it are all your letters,&mdash;all your gifts.<br />
Take them, and give me mine.'<br />

Came as if struggling through a crowd of sobs.<br />

It is a trial merely of our loves?'

'But death to me. As whim or pleasure points,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><br />

You most affect; while I, the home-kept slave<br />
Of others' humors, must brave poverty,<br />
Neglect and cruel treatment.'&mdash;'Did you say<br />
Poverty, Anna?'&mdash;'Do not breathe a word<br />
Of what I tell you: father is a bankrupt,<br />
Or soon will be; and we shall be compelled<br />
To quit our freestone house, and breathe the air<br />
Of squalid want. From that I'd not recoil,<br />
Could I have loving looks and words; for what<br />
Is poverty if there's but love to gild it?<br />
Ah! poverty'&mdash;'Nay, Anna, poverty<br />
You shall not know, only accept from me<br />
The means to fix you in becoming plenty.'<br />
'Never!' she cried; 'ah! cruel to propose it!'<br />
And then more tears; till, touched and foiled, I said,<br />
Looking her in the face while she gazed up<br />
In mine with eager tenderness,&mdash;'Accept<br />
A happy home, if I can help to make it.<br />
We will be married, Anna, when you please.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><br />

Not simply as a bankrupt, but a swindler,<br />
Escaping, by the skin of his teeth, the Tombs.<br />
'No matter! Papa has a son-in-law,<br />
A greenhorn, as they say, who occupies<br />
A stately house on the Fifth Avenue,<br />
And, in his hall, Papa will hang his hat.'<br />

Forgetful of a mirror at their side,&mdash;<br />
To see I was betrayed. He was no brother.<br />
I sought more proof; but they, imagining<br />
I knew more than I did, were swift to act.<br />

Her father on each cheek, and tenderly<br />
Embraced her mother too; and they, the while,<br />
With a slight moisture in their smiling eyes,<br />
Exchanged a nod. Then Percival to Linda:<br />

When Reason may. For some twelve years, I lived<br />
A wandering life in Europe; not so crushed<br />
By my most harsh experience but I<br />
Could find, in study and in change of scene,<br />
How much of relish life has for the mind<br />
As well as the affections; still I felt<br />
Mine was a nature in which these must play<br />
No secondary part; and so the void<br />
Enlarged as age drew nearer; and at forty<br />
A weariness of life came over me,<br />
And I was sick at heart; for many a joy<br />
Had lost the charm that made it joy. I took<br />
A house in London, all for solitude,<br />
And there got what you may not find in Egypt,<br />
Or on Mont Blanc.
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"One day as I was crossing</span><br />
An obscure street, I saw a crowd of workmen<br />
Gathered around a man upon the ground:<br />
A rafter from a half-built house had fallen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><br />
And he was badly injured. Seeing none<br />
To act with promptness in the case, I hailed<br />
A cab, and had him driven to my house.<br />
Finding he was a fellow-countryman,<br />
I gave him one of my spare rooms, and sent<br />
For the best surgeon near. His report was,<br />
The wound itself was nothing serious,<br />
But there was over-action of the brain,<br />
Quite independent, which might lead to danger,<br />
Unless reduced in season; and the patient<br />
Should have the best of watching and attendance,<br />
And not be left to brood on any trouble,<br />
But be kept cheerful. Then with some directions<br />
For diet, sedatives, and laxatives,<br />
The doctor bowed, received his fee, and left.<br />
My guest lay sad and silent for a while,<br />
Then turned to me and said: 'My name is Kenrick;<br />
I'm from Chicago&mdash;was a broker there.<br />
A month ago my wife eloped from me;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><br />

'What do you want of them?'&mdash;'What do I want?'<br />
He stretched his eyes at me inquiringly.<br />
'How strange,' said I, 'the inconsistency!<br />
Here's a true man would try to overtake<br />
An untrue mate! If she's not sterling gold<br />
And loyal as the loadstone,&mdash;not alone<br />
In every act, but every thought and throb,&mdash;<br />
Why should you care who puts her to the proof,<br />
Takes her away, and leaves you free again?<br />
Show me 'tis an illusion I adore,<br />
And I will thank you, though it be in anguish.<br />
To no false gods I bow, if I can help it!'

Where I could take him by the throat, and measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><br />
My strength with his!'&mdash;'Tut, tut! the kind physician<br />
Who warns you of some lurking taint, to which<br />
The cautery should be applied at once,<br />
Is not, in act, if not intent, your friend<br />

And you've been jealous, I suppose, at times,<br />
Of the poor runaway?'&mdash;'Ay, that I have!<br />
Bitterly jealous.'

It only takes what cannot be withheld.<br />
It flies constraint. All that it gives is given,<br />
Even as the lily renders up its perfume,<br />
Because it cannot help it. Would it crave<br />
Return less worthy? Would it be content<br />
With a grudged gift? Then it is something else,<br />

Puts to the proof, revealing emptiness.<br />
Have you a loving heart, and would you feed it<br />
On what the swine have left,&mdash;mock it with lies?'<br />
'Speak this to me again, when I am stronger,'<br />
Said Kenrick, smiling faintly. Then I left him,<br />
And taking up 'The Times' looked thro' the list<br />
Of 'Wants'; and one amid the many hundred<br />
Instantly caught my eye. It merely said:<br />
'Wanted, by a young woman, strong and healthy,<br />
A place as nurse for any invalid.<br />

Of modern fashion." Linda played and sang<br />
A full half-hour; then, turning on her chair,<br />
Said, "Now shall mother sing that cradle ditty<br />
You made for me, an infant. Mother, mine,<br />
Imagine you are rocking me to sleep,<br />
As in those far-off days."<br />

Be ever thus, my Linda; for the pure<br />
In heart shall carry an immortal youth<br />
Into the great to-come. That little song&mdash;<br />
Well I remember the delightful time<br />
When 'twas extemporized; when, with my pen,<br />
I noted down the words, while, by your crib,<br />
Your father sat, and you, with little fists<br />
Drawn tight, would spring and start, as infants will,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><br />
Crowing the while, and chuckling at the words<br />
Not comprehended yet, save in the smiles<br />

Of an autumnal day, and we were staying<br />
In a secluded village, where a brook<br />
Babbled beneath our window, and the hum<br />
Of insects soothed us, while a louder note<br />
From the hoarse frog's bassoon would, now and then,<br />
Break on the cricket's sleepy monotone<br />
And startle laughter." Here the matron paused;<br />

There were eight daughters of us, and of these<br />
I was the fourth. We lived in liberal style,<br />
And did not lack the best society<br />
The city could afford. My heedful mother,<br />
With eight undowered girls to be disposed of,<br />
Fearfully healthy all, and clamorous<br />
For clothes and rations, entered on a plan<br />

Her lonely heart with dreams of what, some day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><br />
Shall lift her sex to nobler life. She took<br />
A journal called 'The Good Time Coming,' filled<br />

In education, physical and mental,<br />
Marriage, the rights of women, modes of living.<br />

At last these had for me a fascination<br />
That quite eclipsed the novels of the day.

How fashion, stupid pride, and love of show,<br />

Empty and frivolous, make men and women<br />
False to their natures, cruel to each other<br />
And to the unborn offspring they devote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><br />
To misery through ill-assorted unions,<br />

She meekly stood. 'Pooh! bring it here next week,'<br />
My mother said. 'No!' turning round, I cried;<br />
'Let her be paid at once; there must be money<br />
In the house somewhere; it may be a loss,<br />
An inconvenience, for her to come back<br />
Just for a trifling sum.'&mdash;'Impertinent!'<br />
My mother kindling, cried.  'Do you rule here?'<br />
'I can return,' timidly said the girl.<br />

And offered it, remarking, 'Keep or sell it,<br />
To hold you good for all your wasted time.'<br />

Pitiless and impure. But let me not<br />
Distrust too far.' Then he turned up the gas,<br />
And, with a scrutiny intent and grave,<br />
Perused my face. 'What is your name?' he asked,<br />
After a silence.&mdash;'Mary Merivale.'<br />
'Well, Mary, I engage you; come at once.<br />
In the next room asleep reclines our patient.<br />

Little by little Percival soon told<br />
The story that you've heard, and more which you<br />
May never hear in earthly interviews.<br />
An eager listener, I would treasure up<br />
Each word, each look; and on my soul at last<br />
Dawned the pure ray by which I saw those traits,<br />
The spirit's own, that harmonized so well<br />
With all the outward showed of good and noble.<br />

Superfluous female children. Look at home!<br />
Have we no ancient social superstitions<br />
Born of the same old barbarous family?<br />
My life, Miss Merivale, has been so crowded<br />

"'How many blunder in mistaking Passion,<br />
Mixed with a little sentiment, for Love!<br />
Passion may lead to Love, as it may lead<br />
Away from Love, but Passion is not Love;<br />
It may exist with Hate; too often leads<br />
Its victim blindfold into hateful bonds,<br />
Under the wild delusion that Love leads.<br />
Love's bonds are adamant, and Love a slave;<br />
And yet Love's service must be perfect freedom.<br />
Candor it craves, for Love is innocent,&mdash;<br />
But no enforced fidelity, no ties<br />
Such as the harem shelters. Dupes are they<br />
Who think that Love can ever be compelled!<br />
Only what's lovely Love can truly love,<br />
And fickleness and falsehood are deformed.<br />
Reveal their features, Love may mourn indeed,<br />
But will not rave. Love, even when abandoned,<br />
Feels pity and not anger for the heart<br />
That could not prize Love's warm fidelity.<br />
But Passion, selfish, proud, and murderous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span><br />

And something in the sadness of my smile<br />
Arrested his attention. But that moment<br />
A girl rushed in with cry of 'O, he's killed&mdash;<br />
Killed, the poor man!'&mdash;'Who?'&mdash;'Mr. Percival!'<br />
The name was like a blow upon my heart,<br />

"But in a moment I was strong. I heard<br />
A scuffling noise of people at the door,<br />

Into a room, and placed upon a bed.<br />
Pale and insensible he lay; a surgeon<br />
Came in; at last we got an explanation:<br />
In rescuing from a frightened horse the child<br />
Of a poor woman, Percival had been<br />
Thrown down, an arm been broken, and the pain<br />
Had made him faint. My nervous laugh of joy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><br />
When I was sure that this was the extreme<br />
Of injury, betrayed my reckless heart,<br />

Was soon himself; the broken limb was set,<br />
And I, engaged to stay another week<br />
To wait on the new patient&mdash;nothing loath.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"The day of his departure, Kenrick drew me<br />
Aside, and, in a whisper, said, 'He loves you!'<br />
'Loves me?' With palms held tightly on my breast<br />
To keep my heart down, I repeated, 'Loves me?'<br />
'Twas hard to credit. 'Pardon me,' said Kenrick,<br />
'If by communication of your secret,<br />
I changed the desolation of his life<br />
To sudden bloom and fragrance, for a moment.'<br />
'A moment only?'&mdash;'Soon his scruples rose:<br />
It cannot be! he said; two mountains lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><br />
Between my fate and hers.&mdash;Two bubbles rather!<br />
Retorted I; let's take their altitude.&mdash;<br />
One is my age.&mdash;That mountain is already<br />
Tunnelled or levelled, since she sees it not.&mdash;<br />
The other is that infamous decree<br />
Against me at the period of my suit,<br />
Granting the guilty party a divorce,<br />
But me prohibiting to wed again.&mdash;<br />
Well, that decree (I answered bitterly)<br />
Would have with me the weight of a request<br />
That I'd hereafter quaff at common puddles<br />
And not at one pure fount; I'd heed the bar<br />
As I would heed the grass-webbed gossamer;<br />
I'd sooner balk a bench of drivellers<br />
Than outrage sacred nature.&mdash;If that bench<br />
Could have you up for bigamy, what then?&mdash;<br />
The dear old dames! they should not have the means<br />
To prove it on me: for the pact should be<br />
'Twixt me and her who would accept my troth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><br />
Freely before high heaven and all its angels:<br />
Witnesses which the sheriff could not summon,<br />
Could not, at least, produce.&mdash;But, Kenrick, you<br />
Do not consider all the risk and pain;<br />
The social stigma, and, should children come,<br />
The grief, the shame, the disrepute to them.&mdash;<br />
To which I answered: God's great gift of life,<br />
Coming through parentage select and pure,<br />
To me is such a sacred, sacred thing,<br />
So precious, so inestimably precious,<br />
That your objections seem of small account;<br />
Since only stunted hearts and slavish minds<br />
Could visit on your children disrepute,<br />
Who fitly could ignore such Brahmanism,<br />
Since they'd be born, most probably, with brains.<br />

Where war's financial sinews, as you know,<br />
Are those of legislation equally;<br />
I'll have a law put through to meet your case;<br />

Percival almost stunned me with his No!<br />
Make <i>me</i> a gutter, adding more pollution<br />
To the fount of public justice? Never! No!<br />
I would not feed corruption with a bribe,<br />
To win release to-morrow. Such a cure<br />
Would be, my friend, far worse than the disease.&mdash;<br />
Then there's no way, said I; and so, farewell!<br />

Thus copious, in the hope his argument<br />

On obstacles that Percival would raise.<br />

Not without some emotion, we two parted.<br />
When the last sound of the retiring wheels<br />
Was drowned in other noises, Percival<br />
Came in, and found me waiting in the parlor.<br />
'Now let me have a talk with you,' he said.<br />
So, in the little parlor we sat down.<br />
I see it now, all vividly before me!<br />
The carpet&mdash;ay, its very hues and figures:<br />
The chandelier, the sofa, the engraving<br />
Of Wellington that hung above the mantel;<br />
The little bookcase, holding Scott and Irving,<br />
And Gibbon's Rome, and Eloisa's Letters;<br />
And, in a vase, upon the marble stand,<br />
An opening rose-bud I had plucked that day&mdash;<br />

What I propose is this: that we now part&mdash;<br />
Part for two years; and when that term shall end,<br />
If we are still in heart disposed as now,<br />

Emptied their sands at last, and then I wrote<br />

In the same old familiar room we met:<br />
Eager I gave my hand; but he drew back,<br />
Folded his arms, and said, with half a smile:<br />

For the support of my betrayer, and<br />
The child, called, by a legal fiction, mine.<br />
To this annoyance of an annual dealing<br />
With her attorney, I would put an end;<br />

Two thirds of all my property at once.<br />

She said: "My lot is as the good God gave it;<br />
And I'd not have it other than it is.<br />
Could a permit from any human lips<br />

With speechless joy and a new pride they gazed<br />
Into her fair and youthful countenance,<br />
Bright with ethereal bloom and tenderness.<br />
Then smoothing back her hair, the father said:<br />
"An anxious thought comes to us now and then,&mdash;<br />
Comes like a cloud: the thought that we as yet<br />
Have no provision from our income saved<br />
For Linda. My few little ventures, made<br />
In commerce, in a profitable hope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><br />
So adversely resulted that I saw<br />
My best advance would be in standing still.<br />
As you have heard, all that we now possess<br />
Is in a life-annuity which ends<br />
With two frail lives&mdash;your mother's and my own.<br />
So, should death overtake us both at once,&mdash;<br />
And this I've looked on as improbable,&mdash;<br />
Our little girl would be left destitute."<br />

"Not destitute, my father!" Linda cried;<br />
"Far back as thought can go, you taught me this:<br />
To help myself; to seek, in my own mind,<br />
Companionship forever new and glad,<br />
Through studies, meditations, and resources<br />
Which nature, books, and crowded life supply.<br />
And then you urged me to excel in something;<br />
('Better do one thing thoroughly,' you said,<br />
'Than fifty only tolerably well,')&mdash;<br />
Something from which, with loving diligence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><br />
I might, should life's contingencies require,<br />
Wring a support;&mdash;and then, how carefully<br />
You taught me how to deal with slippery men!<br />
Taught me my rights, the laws, the very forms<br />
By which to guard against neglect or fraud<br />
In any business&mdash;till I'm half a lawyer.<br />
You taught me, too, how to protect myself,<br />
Should force assail me; how to hold a pistol,<br />
Carry it, fire it&mdash;Heaven save me from the need!<br />
And, when I was a very little girl,<br />
You used to take me round to see the houses<br />
As they were built; the clearing of the land;<br />
The digging of the cellar; the foundations;<br />
You told me that the sand to make the mortar<br />
Ought to be fresh, and not the sea-shore sand;<br />
Else would the salt keep up a certain moisture.<br />
And then we'd watch the framework, and the roofing;<br />
And you'd explain the office and the name<br />
Of every beam, and make me understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><br />
The qualities of wood, seasoning of timber,<br />
And how the masons, and the carpenters,<br />
The plasterers, the plumbers, and the slaters,<br />
Should do their work; and when they slighted it,<br />
And when the wood-work was too near the flue,<br />
The flue too narrow, or the draught defective:<br />
So that, as you yourself have often said,<br />
I'm better qualified than half the builders<br />
To plan and build a house, and guard myself<br />
From being cheated in the operation.<br />
Fear not for me, my parents; spend your income<br />
Without a thought of saving. And besides,<br />
Had you not trained me aptly as you have,<br />
Am I not better&mdash;I&mdash;than many sparrows?<br />
There is a heavenly Father over all!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"Sweet arguer!" said Percival, "may He<br />
And his swift angels love and help our Linda!<br />
Your mother and myself have tried of late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><br />
To study how and where we might reduce<br />
Certain expenses that have been,&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">But here</span><br />
The dinner-bell broke in; and lighter thoughts&mdash;<br />
Thoughts that but skim the surface of the mind,<br />
And stir not its profound&mdash;were interchanged<br />
As now more timely; for the Percivals<br />
Lacked not good appetites, and every meal<br />
Had its best stimulant in cheerfulness.<br />
"Where shall we go to pass our holidays?"<br />
The mother asked: "August will soon be here."<br />
"What says our Linda?" answered Percival:<br />
"The seaside or the mountains shall it be?"<br />
"Linda will go with the majority!<br />
You've spilt the salt, papa; please throw a little<br />
Over your shoulder; there! that saves a quarrel.<br />
To me you leave it, do you? to decide<br />
Where we shall go? Then hear the voice of wisdom:<br />
The mountain air is good, I love the mountains;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><br />
And the sea air is good, I love the sea;<br />
But if you two prefer the mountain air,&mdash;<br />
Go to the mountains. On the contrary,&mdash;"<br />
"She's neutral!" cried the father; "what a dodger<br />
This little girl has grown! Come, now, I'll cast<br />
Into the scale my sword, and say we'll go<br />
To old Cape Ann. Does any slave object?<br />
None. 'Tis a special edict. Pass the peas.<br />
Our rendezvous shall be off Eastern Point.<br />
There shall our Linda try the oar again."
</div><div class="poem">
Dinner was ended, and the gas was lit,<br />
And The Day's last edition had been put<br />
Into his hand to read, when suddenly<br />
Turning to Mary, with a sigh he said:<br />
"Kenrick, I see, is dead&mdash;Kenrick, our friend.<br />
'Died in Chicago on the seventh instant,&mdash;<br />
Leaves an estate valued at seven millions.'"<br />
"Indeed! our faithful Kenrick&mdash;is he dead?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><br />
Leaves he a wife?"&mdash;"Probably not, my dear;<br />
Three months ago he was a single man;<br />
I had a letter from him, begging me,<br />
If I lacked funds at any time to draw<br />
On him, and not be modest in my draft."<br />
"But that was generous; what did you reply?"<br />
"I thanked him for his love, and promised him<br />
He should be first to hear of wants of mine.<br />
Now let us to the music-room adjourn,<br />
And hear what will not jar with our regrets."<br />
They went; and Mary mother played and sang;<br />
Played the 'Dead March in Saul' and sang 'Old Hundred,'<br />
'Come, ye Disconsolate,' 'When thee I seek'&mdash;<br />
And finally these unfamiliar words:&mdash;<br />

<div class="poem">
A day's excursion to a favorite spot&mdash;<br />
Choice nook among the choicest of Long Island,<br />
(Paradise Found, he called it playfully)&mdash;<br />
Had oft been planned; and one day Percival<br />
Said: "Let us go to-day!"&mdash;"No, not to-day!"<br />
Cried Linda, with a shudder.&mdash;"And why not?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><br />
It is the very day of all the year!<br />
There's an elastic coolness in the air,<br />
Thanks to the thunder-shower we had last night:<br />
A day for out-of-doors! Your reasons, Linda?<br />
Tears in your eyes! Nay, I'll not ask for reasons.<br />
We will not go."&mdash;"Yes, father, let us go.<br />
Whence came my No abrupt, I could not say;<br />
It was a sudden freak, and what it meant<br />
You know as well as I. Shall we get ready?"<br />
"Ay, such a perfect day is rare; it seems<br />
To bring heaven nearer to my understanding;<br />
Life, life itself is joy enough! to be,&mdash;<br />
To breathe this ether, see that arch of blue,<br />
Is happiness."&mdash;"But 'tis the soul that makes it;<br />
What would it be, my father, without love?"<br />
"Ay, without love, love human and divine,<br />
No atmosphere of real joy can be."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Not long the time mother and daughter needed<br />
To don their simple, neat habiliments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><br />
A postman handed Percival a letter<br />
As they descended from the door to take<br />
The carriage that would bear them to the station;<br />
For they must go by rail some twenty miles<br />
To reach this paradise of Percival's.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
When they were in the cars, and these in motion,<br />
Percival drew the letter from his pocket,<br />
And, while he read, a strange expression stole<br />
Over his features. "Now what is it, father?"<br />
Then with a sigh which her quick ear detected<br />
As one that masked a pleasurable thought,<br />
He said: "Poor little Linda!"&mdash;"And why poor?"<br />
"Because she will not be so rich again<br />
In wishes unfulfilled. That grand piano<br />
You saw at Chickering's&mdash;what was the price?"<br />
"Twelve hundred dollars only."&mdash;"It is yours!<br />
That painting you admired so&mdash;that by Church&mdash;<br />
What did they ask for it?"&mdash;"Two thousand dollars."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><br />
"'Tis cheap at that. We'll take it. Whose turn-out<br />
Was it that struck your fancy?"&mdash;"Miss Van Hagen's!"<br />
"Well, you shall have one like it, only better.<br />
Look! What a charming cottage! How it stands,<br />
Fronting the water, flanked by woods and gardens!<br />
For sale, I see. We'll buy it. No, that house<br />
Yonder upon the hill would suit us better;<br />
Our coachman's family shall have the cottage."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"What is it all, my father? You perplex me,"<br />
Said Linda, with a smile of anxious wonder.<br />
"In brief, my little girl," said Percival,<br />
"You're grown to be an heiress. Let your mother<br />
Take in that letter. Read it to her, Linda."<br />
It was a letter from executors<br />
Of the late Arthur Kenrick, making known<br />
That in his several large bequests was one<br />
Of a full million, all to Percival.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><br />
The mother's heart flew to the loved ones gone;<br />
She sighed, but not to have them back again;<br />
That were a wish too selfish and profane.<br />
And then, the first surprise at length allayed,<br />
Calmly, but not without a natural joy<br />
At being thus lifted to an affluent lot,<br />
The three discussed their future. Should they travel?<br />
Or should they choose some rural site, and build?<br />
Paradise Found would furnish a good site!<br />
Now they could help how many! Not aloof<br />
From scenes of destitution had they kept:<br />
What joy to aid the worthy poor! To save<br />
This one from beggary! To give the means<br />
To that forsaken widow, overworked,<br />
With her persistent cough, to make a trip,<br />
She and her children, city-pinched and pale,<br />
To some good inland farm, and there recruit!<br />
Many the plans for others they conceived!<br />
Many the joyful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Ah! a shivering crash!</span><br />
A whirl of splintered wood and loosened iron!<br />
Then shrieks and groans of pain....
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A broken rail</span><br />
Had done it all. Now for the killed and wounded!<br />
Ghastly the spectacle! And happy those<br />
Whom Death had taken swiftly! Linda's mother<br />
Was one of these&mdash;a smile upon her lips,<br />
But her breast marred&mdash;peacefully she had passed.<br />
Percival's wound was mortal, but he strove,<br />
Amid the jar of sense, to fix his mind<br />
On one absorbing thought&mdash;a thought for Linda:<br />
For she, though stunned, they told him, would survive,<br />
Motherless, though&mdash;soon to be fatherless!<br />
And something&mdash;ah! what was it?&mdash;must be done,<br />
Done, too, at once. "O gentlemen, come here!<br />
Paper and pen and ink! Quick, quick, I pray you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><br />
No matter! Come! A pencil&mdash;that will do.<br />
Help me to make a will&mdash;I do bequeathe&mdash;<br />
Where am I? What has happened? God be with me!<br />
Yes, I remember now&mdash;the will! the will!<br />
No matter for the writing! Witness ye<br />
That I bequeathe, convey, and hereby give<br />
To this my only child, named Linda&mdash;Linda&mdash;<br />
God! What's my name? Where was I? Percival<br />
To Linda Percival&mdash;Is this a dream?<br />
What would I do? My heart is drowned in blood.<br />
God help me. Linda&mdash;Linda!"
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Then he died;</span><br />
And, chasing from his face that glare of anguish,<br />
Came a smile beatific as if angels<br />
Had soothed his fears and hushed him into calm.
</div>
<div class="poem">
Her father's cry was all unheard by Linda,<br />
Or by her mortal senses all unheard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><br />
Perhaps a finer faculty, removed<br />
From the external consciousness afar,<br />
Took it all in; for when she woke at last<br />
To outward life, and looking round beheld<br />
No sign of either parent, she sank back<br />
Into a trance, and lay insensible<br />
For many hours. Then rallying she once more<br />
Seemed conscious; and observing the kind looks<br />
Of an old woman and a man whose brow<br />
Of thought contrasted with his face of youth,<br />
She calmly said: "Don't fear to tell me all;<br />
I think I know it all; an accident<br />
With loss of life; my father and my mother<br />
Among&mdash;among the killed. Enough! Your silence<br />
Explains it now. So leave me for a while.<br />
Should I need help, I'll call. You're very good."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
When they returned, Linda was sitting up<br />
Against the pillow of the bed; her hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span><br />
Folded upon her breast; her open eyes<br />
Tearless and glazed, as if celestial scenes,<br />
Clear to the inner, nulled the outer vision.<br />
The man drew near, touched her upon the brow,<br />
And said, "My name is Henry Meredith."<br />
She started, and, as on an April sky<br />
A cloud is riven, and through the sudden cleft<br />
The sunshine darts, even so were Linda's eyes<br />
Flooded with conscious lustre, and she woke.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
It was a neatly furnished cottage room<br />
In which she lay, and nodding eglantine,<br />
With its sweet-scented foliage and rath roses,<br />
Rustled and shimmered at the open window.<br />
"How long have I been lying here?" asked Linda.<br />
"Almost two days," said Meredith.&mdash;"Indeed!<br />
I read, sir, what you'd ask me, in your looks;<br />
And to the question on your mind I answer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><br />
If all is ready, let the funeral be<br />
This afternoon. Ay, in the village ground<br />
Let their remains be laid. The services<br />
May be as is convenient." "Of what faith<br />
Were they?"&mdash;"The faith of Christ."&mdash;"But that is vague.<br />
The faith of Christ?  Mean you the faith <i>in</i> Christ?<br />
Faith in the power and need of his atonement?"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"All that I mean is, that they held the faith<br />
Which was the faith of Christ, as manifest<br />
In his own words, unwrenched by others' words.<br />
So to no sect did they attach themselves;<br />
But from all sects drew all the truth they could<br />
In charity; believing that when Christ<br />
Said of the pure in heart, 'They shall see God,'<br />
He meant it; spoke no fragment of a truth;<br />
Deferred no saying, qualifying that;<br />
Set no word-trap for unsuspecting souls;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span><br />
Spoke no oracular, ambiguous phrase,<br />
Intending merely the vicarious pure;<br />
Reserved no strange or mystical condition<br />
To breed fine points of doctrine, or confound<br />
The simple-minded and the slow of faith.<br />
Heart-purity and singleness and love,<br />
Fertile in loving acts, sole proof of these,<br />
Summed up for them, my father and my mother,<br />
All nobleness, all duty, all salvation,<br />
And all religion."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">With a heavy sigh</span><br />
Meredith turned away. "I'll not discuss<br />
Things of such moment now," said he. "One rock,<br />
One only rock, amid the clashing waves<br />
Of human error, have I found,&mdash;the rock<br />
On which Christ built his Church. Heaven show you it!"<br />
"Heaven show me truth! let it be on the rock,<br />
Or in the sand. You'll say Amen to that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><br />
"I say Amen to what the Church approves,<br />
For I myself am weak and fallible,<br />
Depraved by nature, reprobate and doomed,<br />
And ransomed only by the atoning blood<br />
Of a Redeemer more divine than human.<br />
But controversy is not timely now:<br />
The papers, jewels, money, and what clothes<br />
Could properly be taken, you will find<br />
In a small trunk of which this is the key.<br />
At three o'clock the carriage will be ready."
</div><div class="poem">
Linda put forth her hand; he gravely took it,<br />
And holding it in both of his the while,<br />
Said: "Should you lack a friend, remember me.<br />
I was a witness to your father's death.<br />
Your mother must have died without a pang.<br />
He, by a strenuous will, kept death at bay<br />
A minute, and his dying cry was Linda!<br />
Hardly can he have felt his sufferings,<br />
Such the intentness of his thought for you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><br />
The fount of tears was happily struck at last,<br />
And Linda wept profusely. Meredith<br />
Quitted the room; but the old woman sat<br />
Beside the bed, her thin and shrunken fingers<br />
Hiding themselves in Linda's locks of gold,<br />
Or with a soothing motion parting them<br />
From a brow fine and white as alabaster.<br />
At length, like a retreating thunder-storm,<br />
The sobs grew faint and fainter, and then ceased.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
After a pause, said Linda to the lady,<br />
"Is he your grandson?"&mdash;"Ay, my only one;<br />
A noble youth, heir to a splendid fortune;<br />
A scholar, too, and such a gentleman!<br />
Young; ay, not twenty-four! What a career,<br />
Would he but choose! Society is his,<br />
To cull from as he would. He throws by all,<br />
To be a poor tame priest, and take confessions<br />
Of petty scandals and delinquencies<br />
From a few Irish hussies and old women!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><br />
"We all," said Linda, "hear the voice of duty<br />
In different ways, and many not at all.<br />
Honor to him who heeds the sacred claim<br />
At any cost of life's amenities<br />
And tenderest ties! We see the sacrifice;&mdash;<br />
We cannot reckon up the nobleness<br />
It called for, and must call for to the end."<br />

<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> news of the great railroad accident<br />
And of the sudden death of Percival,<br />
Coming so soon upon intelligence<br />
Of his rare fortune in the legacy<br />
From Kenrick, occupied the public mind<br />
For a full day at least, and then was whelmed<br />
In other marvels rushing thick upon it.<br />
The mother and the daughter, who still bore<br />
The name of Percival, came back from Paris<br />
At once, on getting the unlooked-for news.<br />
When Linda, after three weeks had elapsed,<br />
Re-entered, with a swelling heart, the house<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
To her so full of sacred memories,<br />
She was accosted by an officer<br />
Who told her he had put his seal on all<br />
The papers, plate, and jewelry belonging<br />
To the late Albert Percival,&mdash;and asked<br />
If in her keeping were a watch and ring,<br />
Also some money, found upon his person:<br />
If so, would she please give them up, and he,<br />
Who had authority to take them, would<br />
Sign a receipt for all such property,<br />
And then the rightful heir could easily<br />
Dispose of it, as might seem best to her.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"The rightful heir?" gasped Linda, taking in<br />
Not readily the meaning of the words,&mdash;<br />
"Do you not know that I'm the rightful heir<br />
And only child of Albert Percival?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><br />
"Pardon me," said the officer, "the child,<br />
Recognized by the law, is not yourself,<br />
But Harriet Percival, the only heir,&mdash;<br />
For so the court adjudges,&mdash;and to her<br />
All property, both personal and real,<br />
Must be made over. She, no doubt, will deal<br />
Kindly in your peculiar case, and make<br />
A suitable provision&mdash;"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Hold!" cried Linda,</span><br />
Her nostrils' action showing generous blood<br />
As clearly as some matchless courser shows it<br />
After a mighty race,&mdash;"Your business,<br />
But not your comments! And yet, pardon me&mdash;<br />
I'm hasty,&mdash;you meant well; but you would have me<br />
Render you up the watch and pocket-book<br />
Found on my father's person, and delivered<br />
To me his daughter. That I'll only do,<br />
When more authority than you have shown<br />
Compels me, and my lawyer bids me yield."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><br />
"Here is my warrant," said the officer,<br />
"And my instructions are explicit." Then,<br />
The spirit of the gentleman disdaining<br />
The action he was sent for, he rejoined:<br />
"But the law's letter shall not make me do<br />
An incivility, perhaps a wrong.<br />
And so, relying on your truth, I leave you,<br />
Assured that you'll be ready to respond<br />
To all the law can ask. And now, good day!"
</div><div class="poem">
Left to her own decisions, Linda sought<br />
At once the best advice; and such had been<br />
Her training, that she was not ignorant<br />
Who among counsellors were trusted most<br />
In special ways. Kindly and patiently<br />
Her case was taken up and thoroughly<br />
Sifted and tried. No hope! No flaw! No case!<br />
So craftily had every step been taken,<br />
With such precaution and such legal care,&mdash;<br />
So diligently had the mesh been woven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><br />
Enclosing Percival and all of his,&mdash;<br />
That nothing could be done except put off<br />
The payment of the Kenrick legacy<br />
For some six months,&mdash;when it was all made over<br />
To the reputed child, already rich<br />
Through the law's disposition of the sums<br />
Which Percival had been compelled to pay.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
After the legal test, with brave composure<br />
Linda surveyed her lot. Enough was left,<br />
From sale of jewels that had been her mother's,<br />
For a few months' support, with frugal care.<br />
Claim to these jewels and the money found<br />
Upon her mother's person had been laid<br />
Too eagerly by the contesting party,<br />
Who said that Percival, in dying last,<br />
Was heir to the effects; but since the claim<br />
Could only be upheld by proving marriage,<br />
The claimants sorrowfully gave it up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><br />
</div><div class="poem">
One day as Linda stood with folded hands<br />
Before her easel, on which lay a painting<br />
Of flowers autumnal, grouped with rarest skill,&mdash;<br />
The blue-fringed gentian, the red cardinal,<br />
With fern and plumy golden-rod intwined,&mdash;<br />
A knock aroused her, and the opened door<br />
Disclosed a footman, clad in livery,<br />
Who, hat in hand, asked if a lady might<br />
Come up to see the pictures. "Certainly,"<br />
Was the reply; and, panting up the stairs,<br />
A lady came whose blazonry of dress<br />
And air of self-assured, aggressive wealth<br />
Spoke one well pleased to awe servility.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
As when by some forecasting sense the dove<br />
Knows that the hawk, though out of sight and still,<br />
Is hovering near, even so did Linda feel<br />
An enemy draw nigh; felt that this woman,<br />
Who, spite of marks a self-indulgent life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><br />
Leaves on the face, showed vestiges of beauty,<br />
Was she who first had cast the bitterness<br />
Into that cup of youth which Linda's father<br />
Was made to taste so long.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">And yet (how strangely,</span><br />
In this mixed web of life, the strands of good<br />
Cross and inweave the evil!) to that wrong<br />
Might he have tracked a joy surpassing hope,&mdash;<br />
The saving angel who, in Linda's mother,<br />
Had so enriched his being;&mdash;might have tracked<br />
(Mysterious thought!) Linda herself, his child,<br />
The crown of every rapture, every hope
</div>
<div class="poem">
The lady, known as Madame Percival,<br />
Seated herself and turned a piercing look<br />
On Linda, who blenched not, but stood erect,<br />
With calm and serious look regarding her.<br />
The lady was the first to lower her eyes;<br />
She then, with some embarrassment, remarked:<br />
"So! you're an artist! Will you let me see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><br />
Some of your newest paintings?" Linda placed<br />
Three of her choicest pieces on the easel,<br />
And madame raised her eyeglass, looked a moment,<br />
Said, "Very pretty," and then, breaking through<br />
Further constraint, began: "You may not know me;<br />
My name is Percival; you, I suppose,<br />
Bear the same name by courtesy. 'Tis well:<br />
The law at last has taught you possibly<br />
Our relative positions. Of the past<br />
We will say nothing; no hard thought is left<br />
Against you in my heart; I trust I know<br />
The meaning of forgiveness; what is due<br />
To Christian charity. In me, although<br />
The church has but a frail, unworthy child,<br />
Yet would I help my enemy; remove her<br />
From doubtful paths, and see her fitly placed<br />
With her own kindred for protection due.<br />
Hear my proposal now, in your behalf:<br />
If you will go to England, where your aunts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span><br />
And relatives reside,&mdash;and first will sign<br />
A paper promising you'll not return,<br />
And that you never will resume your suit,&mdash;<br />
I will advance your passage-money, and<br />
Give you five thousand dollars. Will you do it?"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
The indignant No, surging in Linda's heart,<br />
Paused as if language were too weak for it,<br />
When, in that pause, the opening of the door<br />
Disclosed a lady younger than the first,<br />
Yet not unlike in features, though no blonde,<br />
And of a figure small and delicate.<br />
"Now, Harriet!" cried the elder of the two,<br />
Annoyed, if not alarmed, "you promised me<br />
You would not quit the carriage."&mdash;"Well, what then?<br />
I changed my mind. Is that a thing uncommon?<br />
Whom have we here? The name upon the door<br />
Is Percival; and there upon the wall<br />
I see a likeness of my father. So!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><br />
You, then, are Linda Percival! the child<br />
For whom he could abandon me, his first!<br />
Come, let me look at you!"&mdash;"Nay, Harriet,<br />
This should not be. Come with me to the carriage;<br />
Come! I command you."&mdash;"Pooh! And pray, who cares<br />
For your commands? I move not till I please.<br />
We are half-sisters, Linda, but I hate you."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"Excuse me," Linda answered quietly,<br />
"But I see no resemblance to my father<br />
In you. Your features, form, complexion, all<br />
Are quite unlike."&mdash;"Silence! We've had enough."<br />
"What did she say?" cried Harriet. "Do not heed<br />
A word of hers; leave her and come with me."<br />
"She said, I bear no likeness to my father:<br />
You heard her!"&mdash;"'Twas in malice, Harriet.<br />
Of course she would say that."&mdash;"But I must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><br />
That photograph of him upon the wall:<br />
'Tis unlike any that I've ever seen."<br />
And with the word she took it from the nail<br />
And would have put it in her pocket, had not<br />
Linda, with sudden grasp, recovered it.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Darker her dark face grew, when Harriet<br />
Saw herself baffled; taking out her purse<br />
She drew from it a thousand-dollar bill,<br />
And said, "Will this procure it?"&mdash;"Harriet!<br />
You're mad to offer such a sum as that."<br />
"Old woman, if you anger me, you'll rue it!<br />
I ask you, Linda Percival, if you<br />
Will take two thousand dollars for that portrait?"<br />
And Linda answered: "I'll not take your money:<br />
The portrait you may have without a price;<br />
I'm not without a copy."&mdash;"Well, I take it;<br />
But mark you this: I shall not hate you less<br />
For this compliance; nay, shall hate you more;<br />
For I do hate you with a burning hatred,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><br />
And all the more for that smooth Saxon face,<br />
With its clear red and white and Grecian outline;<br />
That likeness to my father (I can see it),<br />
Those golden ringlets and that rounded form.<br />
Pray, Madame Percival, where did I get<br />
This swarthy hue, since Linda is so fair,<br />
And you are far from being a quadroon?<br />
Good lady, solve the riddle, if you please."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"There! No more idle questions! Two o'clock?<br />
That camel's hair at Stewart's will be sold,<br />
Unless we go this minute. Such a bargain!<br />
Come, my dear, come!" And so, cajoling, coaxing,<br />
She drew away her daughter, and the door<br />
Closed quickly on the two. But Linda stood<br />
In meditation rapt, as thought went back<br />
To the dear parents who had sheltered her;<br />
Contrasting their ingenuous love sincere<br />
And her own filial reverence, with the scene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><br />
She just had witnessed. So absorbed she was<br />
In visions of the past, she did not heed<br />
The opening of the door, until a voice<br />
Broke in upon her tender revery,<br />
Saying, "I've come again to get your answer<br />
To my proposal." Tranquillized, subdued<br />
By those dear, sacred reminiscences,<br />
Linda, with pity in her tone, replied:<br />
"Madame, I cannot entertain your offer."<br />
"And why not, Linda Percival?" exclaimed<br />
The imperious lady.&mdash;"I'm not bound to give<br />
My reasons, madame."&mdash;"Come, I'll make the sum<br />
Ten thousand dollars."&mdash;"Money could not alter<br />
My mind upon the subject."&mdash;"Look you, Linda;<br />
You saw my daughter. Obstinate, self-willed,<br />
Passionate as a wild-cat, jealous, crafty,<br />
Reckless in use of money when her whims<br />
Are to be gratified, and yet at times<br />
Sordid as any miser,&mdash;she'll not stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><br />
At artifice, or violence, or crime,<br />
To injure one she hates&mdash;and you she hates!<br />
Now for your sake and hers, I charge you leave<br />
This country, go to England;&mdash;close at once<br />
With my most liberal offer."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">"Madame, no!</span><br />
This is my home, my birthplace, and the land<br />
Of all my efforts, hopes, and aspirations;<br />
While I have work to do, here lies my field:<br />
I cannot quit America. Besides,<br />
Since candor now is best, I would not take<br />
A dole from you to save myself from starving."<br />
The lady's eyes flashed choler. She replied:<br />
"Go your own gait; and, when you're on the street,<br />
As you'll be soon, blame no one but yourself.<br />
I've done my part. Me no one can accuse<br />
Of any lack of charity or care.<br />
For three weeks more my offer shall hold good.<br />
After that time, expect no further grace."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><br />
And, with a frown which tried to be disdain,<br />
But which, rebuked and humbled, fell before<br />
The pitying candor of plain Innocence,<br />
Out of the room she swept with all her velvet.
</div><div class="poem">
These interviews had made our Linda feel<br />
How quite alone in the wide world she stood.<br />
A letter came, after her parents' death,<br />
From her aunt, Mrs. Hammersley, requesting<br />
A loan of fifty pounds, and telling all<br />
The family distresses and shortcomings:<br />
How this one's husband had proved not so rich<br />
As was expected; how another's was<br />
A tyrant and a niggard, so close-fisted<br />
He parcelled out with his own hands the sugar<br />
For kitchen use; and how another's still,<br />
Though amply able to receive their mother,<br />
A widow now, had yet refused to do it,<br />
And even declined to make a contribution<br />
For her support. And so the gossip ran.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><br />
The picture was not pleasant. With a sigh<br />
Not for herself, but others, Linda penned<br />
A letter to her aunt, relating all<br />
The events that made her powerless to aid<br />
Her needy kinsfolk. She despatched the letter,<br />
Then sat and thought awhile.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"And now for duty!"</span><br />
She cried, and rose. She could not think of duty<br />
Except as something grateful to her parents.<br />
They were a presence so securely felt,<br />
And so related to her every act,&mdash;<br />
Their love was still so vigilant, so real,<br />
That to do what, and only what, she knew<br />
They would approve, was duty paramount;<br />
And their approval was the smile of God!<br />
Self-culture, work, and needful exercise,&mdash;<br />
This was her simple summing-up of duties<br />
Immediately before her, and to be<br />
Fulfilled without more parleying or delay.<br />
She found that by the labor of a month<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><br />
In painting flowers from nature, she could earn<br />
Easily sixty dollars. This she did<br />
For two years steadily. Then came a change.<br />
From some cause unexplained, her wild-flower sketches,<br />
Which from their novelty and careful finish<br />
At first had found a ready sale, were now<br />
In less demand. Linda was not aware<br />
That these elaborate works, to nature true,<br />
Had been so multiplied in copies, made<br />
By hand, or printed by the chromo art,<br />
As to be sold at prices not one fifth<br />
As high as the originals had cost.<br />
Hence her own genius winged the storm and lent<br />
The color to the cloud, that overhung<br />
Her prospect, late so hopeful and serene.
</div><div class="poem">
Now came her year of struggle! Narrow means,<br />
Discouragement, the haunting fear of debt!<br />
One summer day, a day reminding her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><br />
Of days supremely beautiful, immortal,<br />
(Since hallowed by undying love and joy),<br />
A little girl, the step-child, much endeared,<br />
Of a poor artisan who dwelt near by<br />
On the same floor with Linda, came to her<br />
And said: "You promised me, Miss Percival,<br />
That some fine day you'd take me in the cars<br />
Where I could see the grass and pluck the flowers."<br />
"Well, Rachel Aiken, we will go to-day,<br />
If you will get permission from your father,"<br />
Said Linda, longing for the woodland air.<br />
Gladly the father gave consent; and so,<br />
Clad in her best, the little damsel sat,<br />
While Linda filled the luncheon-box, and made<br />
The preparations needful.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"What is that?"</span><br />
Asked Rachel, pointing to an open drawer<br />
In which a case of polished ebony<br />
Glittered and caught the eye. "A pistol-case!"<br />
"And is the pistol loaded?"&mdash;"I believe so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><br />
"And will you take it with you?"&mdash;"Well, my dear,<br />
I did not think to do so: would you have me?"<br />
"Yes, if we're going to the woods; for panthers<br />
Lurk in the woods, you know."&mdash;"I'll take it, Rachel;<br />
We call this a revolver. See! Four times<br />
I can discharge it." At a block of wood<br />
She aimed and fired; then carefully reloaded<br />
The piece, and put it in a hidden pocket.
</div><div class="poem">
Some ten miles from the city, at a place<br />
Rich in diversity of wood and water,<br />
They left the cars. Rachel's delight was wild.<br />
Never was day so lovely! Never grass<br />
So green! And O the flowers! "Look, only look,<br />
Miss Percival! What is it? Can I pluck<br />
As many as I want?"&mdash;"Ay, that's a harebell."<br />
"And O, look here! This red and yellow flower!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span><br />
Tell me its name."&mdash;"A columbine. It grows<br />
In clefts of rocks. That's an anemone:<br />
We call it so because the leaves are torn<br />
So easily by the wind; for <i>anemos</i><br />
Is Greek for wind."&mdash;"Oh! here's a buttercup!<br />
I know that well. Red clover, too, I know.<br />
Isn't the dandelion beautiful?<br />
And O, Miss Percival, what flower is this?"<br />
"That's a wild rose."&mdash;"What, does the rose grow wild?<br />
But is not that delightful? A wild rose!<br />
And I can take as many as I want!<br />
I did not dream the country was so fine.<br />
How very happy must the children be<br />
Who live here all the time! 'Tis better far<br />
Than any garden; for, Miss Percival,<br />
The flowers are here all free, and quite as pretty<br />
As garden flowers. O, hark! Did ever bird<br />
So sweetly sing?"&mdash;"That was a wood-thrush, dear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><br />
"O darling wood-thrush! Do not stop so soon!<br />
Look there, on that stone wall! What's that?"&mdash;"A squirrel."<br />
"Is that indeed a squirrel? Are you sure?<br />
How I would like a nut to throw to him!<br />
What are these little red things in the grass?"<br />
"Wild strawberries, my dear."&mdash;"Wild strawberries!<br />
And can I eat them?"&mdash;"Yes, we'll take a plate<br />
And pick it full, and eat them with our dinner."<br />
"O, will not that be nice? Wild strawberries<br />
That we have picked ourselves!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">And so the day</span><br />
Slid on to noon; and then, it being hot,<br />
They crossed a wall into a skirting wood,<br />
And there sat down upon a rocky slab<br />
Covered with dry brown needles of the pine,<br />
And ate their dinner while the birds made music.<br />
"'Tis a free concert, ours!" said Rachel Aiken:<br />
"How nice this dinner! What an appetite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><br />
I'm having all at once! My father says<br />
That I must learn to eat: I soon could learn<br />
In such a place as this! I wish my father<br />
Himself would eat; he works too hard, I fear;<br />
He works in lead: and the lead makes him ill.<br />
See what nice clothes he buys me! I'm afraid<br />
He pays for me more than he can afford,<br />
Seeing he has a mother to support<br />
And a blind sister; for, Miss Percival,<br />
I'm but his step-child, and my mother died<br />
Two years ago; then my half-sister died,<br />
His only little girl, and now he says<br />
That I am all he has in the wide world<br />
To love and cherish dearly,&mdash;all his treasure.<br />
What would I give if I could bring him here<br />
To these sweet woods, away from lead and work!"
</div><div class="poem">
So the child prattled. Then, the gay dessert<br />
Of berries being ended, Linda sat<br />
On the rock's slope, and peeled the mosses off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><br />
Or looked up through the branches of the pines<br />
At the sky's blue, while Rachel played around.<br />
From tree to tree, from flower to flower, the child<br />
Darted through leafy lanes, when, all at once,<br />
A scream roused Linda.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To her feet she sprang!</span><br />
Instinctively (but not without a shudder)<br />
She grasped the little pistol she had brought<br />
At the child's prompting; from the rock ran down,<br />
And, at a sudden bend, encountered three<br />
Young lusty ruffians, while, a few rods off,<br />
Another lifted Rachel in his arms,<br />
And to the thicker wood beyond moved on.<br />
The three stood side by side as if to bar<br />
The path to Linda, and their looks meant mischief.<br />
The lane was narrow. "For your life, make way!"<br />
She cried, and raised the pistol. "No, you don't<br />
Fool us by tricks like that!" the foremost said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><br />
"And so, my lady&mdash;" But before the word<br />
Was out there was a little puff of smoke,<br />
With an explosion, not encouraging,&mdash;<br />
And on the turf the frightened caitiff lay.<br />
Her road now clear, reckless of torn alpaca,<br />
Over the scattered branches Linda rushed,<br />
Till she drew near the leader of the gang,<br />
Who, stopping, drew a pistol with one hand,<br />
While with the other he held Rachel fast,<br />
Placing her as a shield before his breast.
</div><div class="poem">
But Linda did not waver. Dropping into<br />
The old position that her father taught her<br />
When to the shooting-gallery they went,<br />
She fired. An oath, the cry of pain and rage,<br />
Told her she had not missed her aim,&mdash;the jaw<br />
The ruffian left exposed. One moment more,<br />
Rachel was in her arms. Taking a path<br />
Transverse, they hit the public road and entered<br />
The railroad station as the train came in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span><br />
When they were safely seated, and the engine<br />
Began to throb and pant, a sudden pallor<br />
Spread over Linda's visage, and she veiled<br />
Her face and fainted; yet so quietly,<br />
But one among the passengers observed it;<br />
And he came up, and taking Rachel's place<br />
Supported Linda; from a lady near<br />
Borrowed some pungent salts restorative,<br />
And finding soon the sufferer was herself,<br />
Gave Rachel back her seat and took his own.<br />
But at the city station, when arrived,<br />
This gentleman came up, and bowing, said:<br />
"Here stands my private carriage; but to-day<br />
I need it not. Let my man take you home."<br />
Linda demurred. His firm will urged them in,<br />
And she and Rachel all at once were riding<br />
With easy bowling motion down Broadway.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
The evening papers had this paragraph:<br />
"In Baker's Woods this morning two young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span><br />
Were fired on by a female lunatic<br />
Without a provocation, and one wounded.<br />
The bullet was extracted. Dr. Payson,<br />
With his accustomed skill and promptitude,<br />
Performed the operation; and the patient<br />
Is doing well. We learn the unhappy woman&mdash;<br />
She had with her a child&mdash;is still at large."<br />
"I'm glad it was no worse," quoth Linda, smiling.<br />
She kissed the pistol that had been her mother's,<br />
Wiped it, and reverently put it by.<br />
</div>
<hr style="width: 5em; text-align: left; margin-left: 5em;" />
<div class="poem">
Three summers and an autumn had rolled on<br />
Since the catastrophe that orphaned Linda.<br />
Midwinter with its whirling snow had come,<br />
And, shivering through the snow-encumbered streets<br />
Of the great city, men and women went,<br />
Stooping their heads to thwart the spiteful wind.<br />
The sleigh-bells rang, boys hooted, and policemen<br />
Told each importunate beggar to move on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span><br />
In a side street where Fashion late had dwelt,<br />
But which the up-town movement now had left<br />
A street for journeymen and small mechanics,<br />
Dress-makers, masons, farriers, and draymen,<br />
A female figure might be seen to enter<br />
A lodging-house, and passing up two flights<br />
Unlock a door that showed a small apartment<br />
Neat, with two windows looking on the rear,<br />
A small recess with a low, narrow bed,<br />
A sofa, a piano, and three chairs.<br />
'Twas noon, but in the sky no cleft of blue<br />
Flashed the soft love-light like a lifted lid.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Clad plainly was the lady we have followed,&mdash;<br />
But with a certain grace no modiste's art<br />
Could have contrived. Youthful she was, and yet<br />
A gravity not pertinent to youth<br />
Gave to her face the pathos of that look<br />
Which a too early thoughtfulness imparts;<br />
And this was Linda,&mdash;Linda little changed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><br />
Though nearer by four years to womanhood<br />
Than when we parted from her in the shadow<br />
Of a great woe.<br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Preoccupied she seemed</span><br />
Now with some painful thought, and in a slow,<br />
Half-automatic manner she replenished<br />
With scanty bits of coal her little stove;<br />
Then, with a like absorbed, uncertain air,<br />
Threw off her cloak and bonnet, and sat down;<br />
Motionless sat awhile till she drew forth<br />
A pocket-book, and from it took a letter,<br />
And read these words: "You guaranteed the debt:<br />
It now has run three months, and if to-morrow<br />
It is not paid, we must seek legal help."<br />
A bill of wood and coal for Rachel's father&mdash;<br />
Some twenty dollars only! And yet Linda<br />
Saw not the way to pay it on the morrow.<br />
He, the poor artisan, on whose account<br />
She had incurred the liability,<br />
Lay prostrate with a malady, his last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><br />
In the small room near by, with little Rachel<br />
His only watcher. What could Linda do?<br />
At length, with lips compressed, and up and down<br />
Moving her head as if to give assent<br />
To some resolve, now fixed, she took her seat<br />
At the piano,&mdash;from her childhood's days<br />
So tenderly endeared, and every chord<br />
Vibrating to some memory of her mother!<br />
"Old friend,"&mdash;she sighed; then thought awhile and sang.<br />

When little Rachel, by her father sent,<br />
Came in to take her lesson the next day,<br />
Behold, no instrument was in the room!<br />
What could it mean? "We must give up," said Linda,<br />
"Our music for a little while. Perhaps<br />
I soon shall have my dear piano back."<br />
Then they went in to see the sufferer.<br />
A smile lit up his face,&mdash;a grateful smile,<br />
That lent a beauty even to Disease,<br />
Pale, thin, and hollow-eyed:<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"Is not the air</span><br />

To see to what the morrow may require.<br />
You've done so much, dear lady, I refrain<br />
From asking more."&mdash;"Ask all that you would have."<br />
"My little Rachel&mdash;she will be alone,<br />
All, all alone in this wide, striving world:<br />
An orphan child without a relative!<br />

In some asylum?"&mdash;"Do not doubt my zeal<br />

How careful, too, of all your pretty clothes;<br />

Rachel, obey Miss Percival. Be quick<br />
To shun all evil. Fly from heedless playmates.<br />
Close your young eyes on all impurity.<br />
Cast out all naughty thoughts by holy prayer.<br />

But God ordains it otherwise. May He<br />

Weighing my words: I know it all is true.<br />
God bless you both. I'm very, very happy.<br />
My pain is almost gone. I'll sleep awhile."<br />
Rachel and Linda sat an hour beside him,<br />
Silently watching. Linda then arose<br />
And placed her hand above his heart: 'twas still.<br />
Tranquilly as the day-flower shuts its leaves<br />
And renders up its fragrance to the air,<br />
From the closed mortal senses had he risen.<br />

<div class="poem">
One day the tempter sat at Linda's ear:<br />
Sat and discoursed&mdash;so piously! so wisely!<br />
She held a letter in her hand; a letter<br />
Signed Jonas Fletcher. Jonas was her landlord;<br />
A man of forty&mdash;ay, a gentleman;<br />
Kind to his tenants, liberal, forbearing;<br />
Rich and retired from active business;<br />
A member of the Church, but tolerant;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><br />
A man sincere, cordial, without a flaw<br />
In habits or in general character;<br />
Of comely person, too, and cheerful presence.<br />
Long had he looked on Linda, and at last<br />
Had studied her intently; knew her ways,<br />
Her daily occupations; whom she saw,<br />
And where she went. He had an interest<br />
Beyond that of the landlord, in his knowledge;<br />
The letter was an offer of his hand.<br />
Of Linda's parentage and history<br />
He nothing knew, and nothing sought to know.<br />
He took her as she was; was well content,<br />
With what he knew, to run all other risks.<br />
The letter was a good one and a frank;<br />
It came to Linda in her pinch of want,<br />
Discouragement, and utter self-distrust.<br />
And thus the tempter spoke and she replied:<br />

Esteem your specialty. Your specialty!<br />
As if a woman could have more than one,&mdash;<br />
And that&mdash;maternity! I do not speak<br />
Of the six years you gave your art before<br />
You strove to make it pay. Methinks you see<br />
Your efforts are a failure. What's the end<br />

Musing before a picture Linda sat.<br />
"In my poor little range of art," thought she,<br />
"I feel an expert's confidence; I know<br />
These things are unexcelled; and yet why is it<br />
They do not bring their value? Come, I'll try<br />
Something more difficult,&mdash;put all my skill,<br />
Knowledge, and work into one little piece."<br />
Bravely she strove: it was a simple scene,<br />
But with accessories as yet untried,<br />
And done in oil with microscopic care;<br />
An open window with a distant landscape,<br />
And on the window-sill a vase of flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><br />
It was a triumph, and she knew it was.<br />
"Come, little housekeeper," she said to Rachel,<br />
"We'll go and seek our fortune." So she put<br />
Under her arm the picture, and they went<br />
To show it to the dealer who had bought<br />
Most of her works. But on her way she met<br />
A clerk of the establishment, who said:<br />
"Come into Taylor's here and take an ice;<br />
I'd like to tell you something for your good."<br />

When they all three were seated, Brown began:<br />
"You may not see me at the store again;<br />
For a ship's cousin wants my place, and so,<br />
With little ceremony, I'm dismissed.<br />
Now, if you've no objection, tell me what<br />
The old man gave you for that composition<br />
In which a bird&mdash;a humming-bird, I think&mdash;<br />
Follows a child who has a bunch of flowers."<br />
"Yes, I remember. Well, 'twas fifteen dollars."<br />
"Whew! He said fifty. Is it possible?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><br />
You've seen the chromo copy, I suppose?"<br />
"The chromo? I've seen nothing of a chromo.<br />
Never has my consent been given to publish!"<br />
"That's little to the purpose, it would seem.<br />
A hundred thousand copies have been sold<br />
Of all your pieces, first and last. You stare?"<br />
A light broke in on Linda. All at once<br />
The mystery that hung upon her strivings<br />
Lay solved; the cloud was lifted; and she saw<br />
That all this while she had not weighed her talents<br />
In a false balance; had not been the dupe<br />
Of her own aspirations and desires.<br />
With eyes elate and hope up-springing fresh<br />
In her glad heart, she cried, "And are you sure?"<br />
"'Tis easily confirmed. Go ask the printer;<br />
Only my number is below the mark."<br />

From Brown, then, Linda got particulars,<br />
Showing 'twas not a random utterance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><br />
"'Tis strange," she said, "that I've not seen the chromos<br />
At the shop windows."&mdash;"Only recently,"<br />
Said he, "have they been sold here in the city;<br />
The market has been chiefly at the West.<br />
The old man thought it policy, perhaps,<br />
To do it on the sly, lest you should know.<br />
Well, well, in that bald head of his he has<br />
A mine!" Then Linda struck the bell, and said:<br />
"This is my entertainment, Mr. Brown;<br />
Please let me pay for it." And Brown's "O no"<br />
Was not so wholly irresistible<br />
That Linda did not have her way in this.<br />
They parted.<br />

However; not quite thirty-five, in fact.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><br />
The capital which made his note so good<br />
Was a bald head; a head you could not question;<br />
A head which was a pledge of solvency,<br />
A warrant of respectability!<br />
The scalp all glossy; tufts above the ears!<br />
This head he cultivated carefully,<br />
And always took his hat off when he went<br />
To ask a discount or to clinch a bargain.<br />
"Ah! my young friend, Miss Percival," he cried,<br />
"You've something choice there, if I'm not mistaken."<br />
Linda took off the wrapper from her picture<br />
And showed it.
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">An expression of surprise</span><br />
Came to the "old man's" features; but he hid it<br />

These were his exclamations: "Clever! Ay!<br />
Style somewhat new; landscape a shade too bright;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><br />
The sky too blue, eh? Still a clever picture,&mdash;<br />
One of your best. Shall we say twenty dollars?"<br />
Taking the picture, Linda said, "Good morning!<br />
I'm in a hurry now, and you'll excuse me."<br />
"Will you not leave it?"&mdash;"No, I'm not disposed<br />
To part with it at present."&mdash;"Thirty dollars<br />
Would be a high price for it, but to aid you<br />
I'll call it thirty."&mdash;"Could you not say fifty?"<br />
"You're joking with me now, Miss Percival."<br />
"Then we will end our pleasantry. Good by."<br />
"Stay! You want money: I shall be ashamed<br />
To let my partners know it, but to show<br />
How far I'll go for your encouragement&mdash;<br />
Come! I'll say fifty dollars."
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The "old man"</span><br />
Lowered his head, so that the burnished scalp<br />
Might strike her eye direct. Impenetrable<br />
To that appeal, Linda said: "I can get<br />
A hundred for it, I believe. Good day!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><br />
"Stop, stop! For some time our intent has been<br />
To make you a small present as a proof<br />
Of our regard; now will I merge it in<br />
A hundred dollars for the picture. Well?"<br />
"Nay, I would rather not accept a favor.<br />
I must go now,&mdash;will call again some day."<br />
Desperate the "old man" moved his head about<br />
In the most striking lights, and patted it<br />
Wildly at last, as if by that mute act<br />
To stay the unrelenting fugitive.<br />
In vain! She glided off, and Rachel with her.<br />
"Where now, Miss Percival?"&mdash;"To make a call<br />
Upon a lawyer for advice, my dear."

Thoughtfully Diggin listened to the case,<br />
So clearly stated that no part of it<br />
Was left to disentangle. "Let me look,"<br />

As it will be&mdash;we'll corner the 'old man,'<br />

The picture was removed, as he foretold.<br />
Ten weeks went by; then Linda got it back.<br />

"Here are three hundred dollars. You start back!<br />

On all you borrow. Oh! You do not like<br />
To be in debt. This is my risk, not yours.<br />
If I recover nothing, then no debt<br />
Shall be by you incurred,&mdash;so runs the bond!<br />
Truly, now, 'tis no sentimental loan:<br />
I trust another's solvency, not yours.<br />
At length you understand me,&mdash;you consent!<br />
Now do not go to work; but you and Rachel<br />
Go spend a long vacation at the seaside.<br />
You want repose and sunshine and pure air.<br />
Be in no hurry to return. The longer<br />
You're gone, the better. For a year at least<br />
We must keep dark. That puzzles you. No matter.<br />

On the seat back of them, two gentlemen<br />
Chatted at intervals in tones which Linda<br />
Could hardly fail to hear, though little heeding.<br />
But now and then, almost unconsciously,<br />
She found herself attending to their prattle.<br />
Said Gossip Number One: "You see that veteran<br />
In the straw hat, and the young man beside him:<br />
Father and son are they. Old Lothian,<br />
Five months ago, was high among the trusted<br />
Of our chief bankers; Charles, his only son,<br />
By a maternal uncle's death enriched,<br />
Kept out of Wall Street; turned a stolid ear<br />
To all high-mounting schemes for doubling wealth,<br />
His taste inclining him to art and letters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span><br />
But Lothian had a partner, Judd,&mdash;a scamp,<br />
As the result made evident; and Judd<br />
One day was missing; bonds, securities,<br />
And bills, deposits of confiding folk,<br />
Guardians, and widows, and old men retired,<br />
All had been gobbled up by Judd&mdash;converted<br />
Into hard cash&mdash;and Judd had disappeared.<br />
Despair for Lothian! a man whose word<br />
No legal form could make more absolute.<br />
Crushed, mortified, and rendered powerless,<br />
He could not breast the storm. The mental strain<br />
Threw him upon his bed, and there he lay<br />
Till Charles, from Italy in haste returning,<br />
Found his old sire emaciate and half dead<br />
From wounded honor. 'Come! no more of this!'<br />
Cried Charles; 'how happened it that you forgot<br />
You had a son? All shall be well, my father.'<br />
He paid off all the liabilities,<br />
And found himself without three thousand dollars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span><br />
Out of a fortune of at least a million.<br />
What shall we call him, imbecile or saint?<br />
His plan is now to set up as a teacher.<br />
Of such a teacher let each thrifty father<br />
Beware, or he may see his only son<br />
Turn out a poor enthusiast,&mdash;perhaps&mdash;<br />
Who knows?&mdash;an advocate of woman's rights!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Attracted by the story, Linda tried<br />
To get a sight of him, the simpleton;<br />
And, when she saw his face, it seemed to her<br />
Strangely familiar. Was it in a dream<br />
That she had once beheld it? Vain the attempt<br />
Of peering memory to fix the where<br />
And when of the encounter! Yet she knew<br />
That with it was allied a grateful thought.<br />
Then Rachel spoke and made the puzzle clear:<br />
"The man who sent us in his carriage home,<br />
That day you fainted,&mdash;don't you recollect?"<br />
"Ay, surely! 'tis the same. No dream-face that!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span><br />
Charles Lothian, is he? If his acts are folly,<br />
Then may I be a fool! Such fools are rare.<br />
How tender of his father he appears!<br />
I wonder where they're going."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">When, at Springfield,</span><br />
Father and son got out, a sigh, or rather<br />
The ghost of one, and hardly audible,<br />
Escaped from Linda. Then Charles Lothian,<br />
While the cars waited, caught her eye, and bowed.<br />
So he remembered her! "Now that was odd.<br />
But the bell sounds; the locomotive puffs;<br />
The train moves on. Charles Lothian, good by!<br />
Eastward we go; away from you&mdash;away&mdash;<br />
Never to meet again in this wide world;&mdash;<br />
Like ships that in mid-ocean meet and part,<br />
To meet no more&mdash;O, nevermore&mdash;perchance!"

<h2 class="chapter">BY THE SEASIDE.</h2>
<br />
<div class="poem">
<span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">orne</span> swiftly to the North Cape of the Bay,<br />
Still on the wings of steam the travellers went;<br />
And tenderly the purple sunset smiled<br />
Upon their journey's end; a little cottage<br />
With oaks and pines behind it, and, before,<br />
High ocean crags, and under them the ocean,<br />
Unintercepted far as sight could reach!<br />
Foliage and waves! A combination rare<br />
Of lofty sylvan table-land, and then&mdash;<br />
No barren strip to mar the interval&mdash;<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
The watery waste, the ever-changing main!<br />
Old Ocean, with a diadem of verdure<br />
Crowning the summit where his reach was stayed!<br />
The shore, a line of rocks precipitous,<br />
Piled on each other, leaving chasms profound,<br />
Into whose rifts the foamy waters rushed<br />
With gurgling roar, then flowed in runlets back<br />
Till the surge drove them furiously in,<br />
Shaking with thunderous bass the cloven granite!<br />
Yet to the earth-line of the tumbled cliffs<br />
The wild grass crept; the sweet-leafed bayberry<br />
Scented the briny air; the fern, the sumach,<br />
The prostrate juniper, the flowering thorn,<br />
The blueberry, the clinging blackberry,<br />
Tangled the fragrant sod; and in their midst<br />
The red rose bloomed, wet with the drifted spray.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><br />
From the main shore cut off, and isolated<br />
By the invading, the circumfluent waves,<br />
A rock which time had made an island, spread<br />
With a small patch of brine-defying herbage,<br />
Is known as Norman's Woe; for, on this rock,<br />
Two hundred years ago, was Captain Norman,<br />
In his good ship from England, driven and wrecked<br />
In a wild storm, and every life was lost.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Stand on the cliff near by,&mdash;southeasterly<br />
Are only waves on waves to the horizon;<br />
But easterly, less than two miles across,<br />
And forming with the coast-line, whence you look,<br />
The harbor's entrance, stretches Eastern Point,<br />
A lighthouse at its end; a mile of land<br />
Arm-like thrust out to keep the ocean off;<br />
So narrow that beyond its width, due east,<br />
You see the Atlantic glittering, hardly made<br />
Less inconspicuous by the intervention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span><br />
The cottage fare, the renovating breeze,<br />
The grove, the piny odors, and the flowers,<br />
Rambles at morning and the twilight time,<br />
Sea-bathing, joyous and exhilarant,<br />
Siestas on the rocks, with inhalations<br />
Of the pure breathings of the ocean-tide,&mdash;<br />
Soon wrought in both the maidens visible change.<br />
Each day their walks grew longer, till at last<br />
A ten-mile tramp was no infrequent one.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"And where to-day?" asked Rachel, one fair morning.<br />
"To Eastern Point," said Linda; "with our baskets!<br />
For berries, there's no place like Eastern Point;<br />
Blackberries, whortleberries, pigeon-pears,&mdash;<br />
All we shall find in prodigality!"<br />
And so by what was once the old stage-road<br />
Contiguous to the shore, and through the woods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Though long abandoned save by scenery-hunters,<br />
And overgrown with grass and vines and bushes;<br />
Then leaving on their right the wooded hill<br />
Named from the rattlesnakes, now obsolete;<br />
Then by the Cove, and by the bend of shore<br />
Over Stage-rocks, by little Half-moon beach,<br />
Across the Cut, the Creek, by the Hotel,<br />
And through the village, even to Eastern Point,&mdash;<br />
The maidens went, and had a happy day.<br />
And, when the setting sun blazed clear and mild,<br />
And every little cloud was steeped in crimson,<br />
To a small wharf upon the harbor side,<br />
Along the beach they strolled, and looked across<br />
The stretch of wave to Norman's Woe;&mdash;and Linda<br />
Wistfully said: "Heigho! I own I'm tired;<br />
And you, too, Rachel, you look travel-worn,<br />
And hardly good for four miles more of road.<br />
Could we but make this short cut over water!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span><br />
What would I give now for a boat to take us<br />
To Webber's Cove! O, if some timely oarsman<br />
Would only come and say, 'Fair demoiselles,<br />
My skiff lies yonder, rocking on the tide,<br />
And eager to convey you to your home!'<br />
Then would I&mdash;&mdash;Rachel!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">"What, Miss Percival?"</span><br />
"Look at those men descending from the ridge!"<br />
"Well, I can see an old man and a young."<br />
"And is that all you have to say of them?"<br />
"How should I know about them? Ah! I see!<br />
Those are the two we met three weeks ago,&mdash;<br />
The day we left New York,&mdash;met in the cars."<br />
"Ay, Rachel, and their name is Lothian;<br />
Father and son are they. Who would have thought<br />
That they would find their way to Eastern Point?"<br />
"Why not, as well as we, Miss Percival?<br />
Look! To the wharf they go; and there, beside it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span><br />
If I'm not much mistaken, lies a boat.<br />
The wished-for oarsman he! O, this is luck!<br />
They're going to the boat,&mdash;he'll row us over,<br />
I'll run and ask him. See you to my basket."<br />
"Rachel! Stop, Rachel! Fie, you forward girl!<br />
Don't think of it: come back! back, back, I say!"
</div><div class="poem">
But Rachel did not hear, or would not heed,<br />
Straight to the boat she ran, and, as the men<br />
Drew nigh and stopped,&mdash;to Linda's dire dismay<br />
She went up and accosted them, and pointed<br />
To Norman's Woe,&mdash;then back to her companion,&mdash;<br />
And then, with gesture eloquent of thanks<br />
For some reply the younger man had made,<br />
She seemed to lead the way, and he to follow<br />
Along the foot-path to the granite bench<br />
Where Linda sat, abashed and wondering.<br />
And, when they stood before her, Rachel said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span><br />
"Miss Percival, here's Mr. Lothian;<br />
He has a boat near by, and will be glad<br />
To give us seats and row us both across."<br />
Charles Lothian bowed, and Linda, blushing, said,<br />
"Against my orders did this little lady<br />
Accost you, sir, but I will not affect<br />
Regret at her success, if you're content."<br />
"More than content, I'm very glad," said Charles;<br />
"My boat is amply large enough for four,<br />
And we are bound, it seems, all the same way.<br />
My father and myself have taken rooms<br />
At Mistress Moore's, not far from where you live:<br />
So count your obligation very slight."<br />
"An obligation not the first!" said Linda.<br />
"So much the better!" said Charles Lothian:<br />
"Come, take my arm, and let me hold your basket.<br />
What noble blackberries! I'll taste of one."<br />
"Why not of two? As many as you will?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span><br />
"Thank you. You've been adventurous, it seems."<br />
"Yes, Fortune favors the adventurous:<br />
See the old proverb verified to-day!"<br />
"Praise a good day when ended. Here's my father:<br />
Father, Miss Percival!" The senior bowed,<br />
And said, "I used to know&mdash;" And then, as if<br />
Checked by a reminiscence that might be<br />
Unwelcome, he was silent, and they went<br />
All to the boat. "Please let me take an oar,"<br />
Said Linda. "Can you row?" asked Charles. "A little!<br />
My father taught me." Then old Lothian<br />
Looked at her with a scrutinizing glance.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
The ocean billows melted into one,<br />
And that stretched level as a marble floor.<br />
All winds were hushed, and only sunset tints<br />
From purple cloudlets, edged with fiery gold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><br />
And a bright crimson fleece the sun had left,<br />
Fell on the liquid plain incarnadined.<br />
The very pulse of ocean now was mute;<br />
From the far-off profound, no throb, no swell!<br />
Motionless on the coastwise ships the sails<br />
Hung limp and white, their very shadows white.<br />
The lighthouse windows drank the kindling red,<br />
And flashed and gleamed as if the lamps were lit.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"A heavenly eve!" sighed Linda, rapt in praise,<br />
As with poised oars the two looked oceanward.<br />
Then, keeping time, they pulled out from the shore.<br />
"But you row well!" cried Charles. "I might return<br />
The compliment," said Linda. "See that duck!<br />
How near, how still he floats! He seems to know<br />
The holy time will keep him safe from harm."<br />
"Had I a gun," said Charles&mdash;"You would not use it,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><br />
Cried Linda, flushing. "And why not?" quoth he.<br />
"'Nobility obliges'; sympathy<br />
Now makes all nature one and intimate;<br />
And we'd respect, even in a duck, his share<br />
In this tranquillity, this perfect rest."<br />
"I'm glad, then, that I'm gunless," Charles replied.<br />
"Hear him!" the sire exclaimed; "he'd have you think<br />
He's a great sportsman. Be not duped, my dear!<br />
He will not shoot nor fish! He got a wound<br />
At Gettysburg, I grant you,&mdash;what of that?<br />
He would far rather face a battery<br />
Than kill a duck, or even hook a cunner."<br />
"See now," said Charles, "the mischievous effect<br />
Of this exhilarating Cape Ann air!<br />
'Tis the first taunt I've heard from lips of his<br />
Since my return from Europe. Look you, father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span><br />
If I'm to be exposed before young ladies,<br />
Your rations shall be stopped, and your supply<br />
Of oxygen reduced,&mdash;with no more joking.<br />
Don't eye those berries so feloniously.<br />
Because you've now an appetite,&mdash;because<br />
You've just begun to gain a little flesh,&mdash;<br />
Must I be made the target of your jeers?"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Smiling, but with sad eyes, the father said:<br />
"Ah! Charlie, Charlie, when I think of it,&mdash;<br />
Think how you've thrown, poor boy, your very life<br />
Into the breach of ruin made for me,&mdash;<br />
Sacrificed all, to draw the lethal dart<br />
Out of my wounded honor&mdash;to restore&mdash;"<br />
"Give us a song, Miss Percival, a song!"<br />
Charles, interrupting, said. "The time, the place,<br />
Call for a song. Look! All the lighthouses<br />
Flash greeting to the night. There Eastern Point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><br />
Flames out! Lo, little Ten Pound Island follows!<br />
See Baker's Island kindling! Marblehead<br />
Ablaze! Egg Rock, too, off Nahant, on fire!<br />
And Boston Light winking at Minot's Ledge!<br />
Like the wise virgins, all, with ready lamps!<br />
Now might I turn fire-worshipper, and bow<br />
In adoration at this solemn rite:<br />
I'll compromise, however, for a song."<br />
"Lest you turn Pagan, then, I'll sing," quoth Linda.<br />
And, while they rested on their oars, she sang.<br />
</div>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 95%; margin-left: 5em;"><a name="linsong" id="linsong">LINDA'S SONG.</a></span><br />
<br />
<div class="poem2" style="margin-top: 0em;">
<span class="i2">A little bird flew</span><br />
<span class="i4">To the top of a tree:</span><br />
<span class="i2">The sky it was blue,</span><br />
<span class="i4">And the bird sang to me.</span><br />
So tender and true was the strain<br />
The singer, I hoped, would remain;<br />
O little bird, stay and prolong<br />
The rapture the grief of that song!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><br />
</div>
<div class="poem2" style="margin-top: 0em;">
<span class="i2">A little thought came,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Came out of my heart;</span><br />
<span class="i2">It whispered a name</span><br />
<span class="i4">That made me to start:</span><br />
And the rose-colored breath of my sigh<br />
Flushed the earth and the sea and the sky.<br />

And gladden my life with thy ray!<br />
</div>
<br />
<div class="poem">
"Such singing lured Ulysses to the rocks!"<br />
Old Lothian said, applauding. "Charles, look out,<br />
Or, ere we reck of it, this reckless siren<br />
Will have us all a wreck on Norman's Woe.<br />
See to your oars!&mdash;Where are we drifting, man?"<br />
"Who would not drift on such a night as this?"<br />
Said Charles; "all's right." Then, heading for the Cove,<br />
Slowly and steadily the rowers pulled.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
But, when the moon shone crescent in the west,<br />
And the faint outline of the part obscured<br />
Thread-like curved visible from horn to horn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
And Jupiter, supreme among the orbs,<br />
And Mars, with rutilating beam, came forth,<br />
And the great concave opened like a flower,<br />
Unfolding firmaments and galaxies,<br />
Sparkling with separate stars, or snowy white<br />
With undistinguishable suns beyond,&mdash;<br />
They paused and rested on their oars again,<br />
And looked around,&mdash;in adoration looked.<br />
For, gazing on the inconceivable,<br />
They felt God is, though inconceivable;&mdash;<br />
And, while they mutely worshipped, suddenly<br />
A change came over Linda's countenance,<br />
And her glazed mortal eyes were functionless;<br />
For there, before her in the boat, stood two<br />
Unbidden, not unwelcome passengers,<br />
Her father and her mother....<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"Why, Miss Linda,</span><br />
Wake! Are you sleeping? What has been the matter?<br />
Here we've been waiting for you full five minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><br />
And I have called, and Mr. Lothian<br />
He too has called, and yet you make no answer!"<br />
"Rachel! What is it? There! Excuse me all,<br />
If I seemed impolite. Now, then, I'm ready.<br />
A strong pull shall it be? So! Let her dart!"
</div><div class="poem">
And in ten minutes they were at the landing<br />
And on their homeward way; and, as they parted,<br />
The spoils were shared, and the old man accepted<br />
One of the baskets, and all cried, "Good night!"<br />
</div>
<hr style="width: 5em; text-align: left; margin-left: 5em;" />
<div class="poem">
The morning sea-fog like an incense rose<br />
Up to the sun and perished in his beam;<br />
The sky's blue promise brightened through the veil.<br />
With her unopened sketch-book in her hand,<br />
Linda stood on the summit looking down<br />
On Norman's Woe, and felt upon her brow<br />
The cooling haze that foiled the August heat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><br />
Near her knelt Rachel, hunting curiously<br />
For the fine purple alg&aelig; of the clefts.<br />
Good cause had Linda for a cheerful heart;<br />
For had she not that day received by mail<br />
A copy of "The Prospect of the Flowers,"&mdash;<br />
Published in chromo, and these words from Diggin?<br />
"Your future is assured: my bait is swallowed,<br />
Bait, hook, and sinker, all; now let our fish<br />
Have line enough and time enough for play,<br />
And we will land him safely by and by.<br />
A good fat fish he is, and thinks he's cunning.<br />
Enclosed you'll find a hundred-dollar bill;<br />
Please send me a receipt. Keep very quiet."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
Yet Linda was not altogether happy.<br />
Why was it that Charles Lothian had called<br />
Once, and once only, after their adventure?<br />
Called just to ask her, How she found herself?<br />
And, Did she overtask herself in rowing?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span><br />
How happened it, in all her walks and rambles,<br />
They rarely met, or, if they met, a bow<br />
Formal and cold was all the interview?<br />
While thus she mused, she started at a cry:<br />
"Ah! here's our siren, cumbent on the rocks!<br />
Where should a siren be, if not on rocks?"<br />
Old Lothian's voice! He came with rod and line<br />
To try an angler's luck. Behind him stepped<br />
Charles, who stood still, as if arrested, when<br />
He noticed Linda.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Then, as if relenting</span><br />
In some resolve, he jumped from rock to rock<br />
To where she leaned; and, greeting her, inquired:<br />
"Have you been sketching?"&mdash;"No, for indolence<br />
Is now my occupation."&mdash;"Here's a book;<br />
May I not look at it?"&mdash;"You may."&mdash;"Is this<br />
An album?"&mdash;"'Tis my sketch-book."&mdash;"Do you mean<br />
These are your sketches, and original?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><br />
"Ay, truly, mine; from nature every one."<br />
"But here we have high art! No amateur<br />
Could color flower like that."&mdash;"Ah! there you touch me;<br />
For I'm no amateur in painting flowers,&mdash;<br />
I get my living by it."&mdash;"I could praise<br />
That sea-view also,&mdash;what a depth of sky!<br />
That beach,&mdash;that schooner flying from a squall,&mdash;<br />
If I'm a judge, here's something more than skill!"
</div><div class="poem">
Then the discourse slid off to woman's rights;<br />
For Lothian held a newspaper which told<br />
Of some convention, the report of which<br />
Might raise a smile. One of the lady speakers,<br />
It seems, would give her sex the privilege<br />
Of taking the initiative in wooing,<br />
If so disposed!<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Indeed, why not?" cried Linda.</span><br />
"Indeed, you almost take my breath away<br />
With your Why not, Miss Percival! Why not?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><br />
"Yes, I repeat,&mdash;if so disposed, why not?<br />
For why should woman any more than man<br />
Play the dissembler, with so much at stake?<br />
I know the ready taunt that here will rise:<br />
'Already none too backward are our girls<br />
In husband-seeking.' Seeking in what way?<br />
Seeking by stratagem and management,&mdash;<br />
Not by frank, honest means! What food for mirth<br />
'Twould give to shallow men to see a woman<br />
Court the relation, intertwined with all<br />
Of purest happiness that she may crave,&mdash;<br />
The ties of wife and mother! O, what pointing,<br />
Sneering, and joking! And yet why should care<br />
Thoughtful and pure and wisely provident,<br />
That Nature's sacred prompting shall not fail,<br />
Be one thing for a man, and quite another<br />
For her, the woman? Why this flimsy mask?<br />
This playing of a part, put on to suit,<br />
Not the heart's need, but Fashion custom-bound?<br />
Feigning we must be sought, and never seek?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span><br />
Now, through these social hindrances and bars,<br />
The bold, perhaps the intriguing, carry off<br />
Prizes the true and modest ought to win.<br />
And so we hear it coarsely said of husbands,<br />
'Better a poor one far, than none at all!'<br />
A thought ignoble, and which no true woman<br />
Should harbor for a moment. Give her freedom,<br />
Freedom to seek, and she'll not harbor it!<br />
Because if woman, equally with man,<br />
Were privileged thus, she would discriminate<br />
Much more than now, and fewer sordid unions<br />
Would be the sure result. For what if man<br />
Were chained to singleness until some woman<br />
Might seek his hand in marriage, would he be<br />
Likely as now to make a wise election?<br />
Would he not say, 'Time flies; my chances lessen<br />
And I must plainly take what I can get?'<br />
True, there are mercenary men enough,<br />
Seeking rich dowries; they'd find fewer dupes,<br />
Were women free as men to seek and choose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span><br />
Banish the senseless inequality,<br />
And you make marriage less a vulgar game<br />
In which one tries to circumvent the other.<br />
Oh! all this morbid ribaldry of <i>men</i>,<br />
And all this passive imbecility,<br />
And superstitious inactivity,<br />
Dissimulation and improvidence,<br />
False shame and lazy prejudice of <i>women</i>,<br />
Where the great miracle of sex concerns us,<br />
And Candor should be innocently wise,<br />
And Knowledge should be reverently free,&mdash;<br />
Is against nature,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;helps to hide the way<br />
Out of the social horrors that confound us,<br />
And launches thousands into paths impure,<br />
Shutting them out from holy parentage."
</div><div class="poem">
"I hold," said Charles, "the question is not one<br />
Of reasoning, but of simple sentiment.<br />
As it would shock me, should a woman speak<br />
In virile baritone, so would I shudder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span><br />
To hear a grave proposal marriageward<br />
In alto or soprano."

Depend on love," said Linda; "love potential,<br />
Or present."&mdash;"Nay, 'twould frighten love!" cried Charles,&mdash;<br />
"Kill it outright."&mdash;"Then would it not be love!<br />
What! would you love a woman less because<br />
She durst avow her love, before the cue<br />
Had been imparted by your lordly lips?<br />
Rare love would that be truly which could freeze<br />
Because the truth came candid from her heart,<br />
And in advance of the proprieties!"<br />
"But may the woman I could love," cried Charles,<br />
"Forbear at least the rash experiment!"<br />
"I doubt," said Linda, "if you know your heart;<br />
For hearts look to the substance, not the form.<br />
Why should not woman seek her happiness<br />
With brow as unabashed as man may wear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span><br />
In seeking his? Ah! lack of candor here<br />
Works more regrets, for woman and for man,<br />
Than we can reckon. Let but woman feel<br />
That in the social scheme she's not a cipher,<br />
The remedy, be sure, is not far off."
</div><div class="poem">
"To me it seems," said Lothian, "that you war<br />
Against our natural instincts: have they not<br />
Settled the point, even as the world has done?"<br />
Said Linda: "Instincts differ; they may be<br />
Results of shallow prejudice or custom.<br />
The Turk will tell you that polygamy<br />
Is instinct; and the savage who stalks on<br />
In dirty painted grandeur, while his squaw<br />
Carries the burdens, might reply that instinct<br />
Regulates that. So instinct proves too much.<br />
Queens and great heiresses are privileged<br />
To intimate their matrimonial choice,&mdash;<br />
Simply because superiority<br />
In power or riches gives an apt excuse:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span><br />
Let a plurality of women have<br />
The wealth and power, and you might see reversed<br />
What now you call an instinct. When a higher<br />
Civilization shall make woman less<br />
Dependent for protection and support<br />
On man's caprice or pleasure, there may be<br />
A higher sort of woman; one who shall<br />
Feel that her lot is more in her own hands,<br />
And she, like man, a free controlling force,<br />
Not a mere pensioner on paternal bounty<br />
Until some sultan throws the handkerchief."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
A cry of triumph from the fisherman,<br />
Exuberant at having caught a bass,<br />
Here ended the discussion, leaving Linda<br />
With the last word. Charles went to chat with Rachel;<br />
And Linda, summoned by vociferations<br />
From the excited, the transported captor,<br />
Descended to inspect the amazing fish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><br />
"A beauty, is it not, Miss Percival?<br />
A rare one, too, for this part of the coast!<br />
'Twill be a study how to have it cooked.<br />
Now sit here, in the shadow of this rock.<br />
Your father's name was Albert Percival?<br />
So I supposed. I've often heard my wife<br />
Speak of him as of one she knew was wronged<br />
Most foully in his wrestle with the law.<br />
Have you not met with Harriet Percival?"<br />
"Once only, and our interview was brief.<br />
Is she not married?"&mdash;"No, nor like to be,<br />
Although her fortune is a pretty one,<br />
Even for these times,&mdash;two millions, I believe;<br />
All which her mother may inherit soon;<br />
For Harriet is an invalid, but hoards<br />
Her income quite as thriftily as if<br />
She looked for progeny and length of days.<br />
The mother, as you may not be aware,<br />
Has married an aspiring gentleman<br />
Who means to build a palace on the Hudson,<br />
And Harriet's money hence is greatly needed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span><br />
The mist now cleared, and the sun shone in power,<br />
So that the heat soon drove them to the woods.<br />
The senior took his capture home for dinner;<br />
Rachel strolled, picking berries by the brook;<br />
And, under lofty pines, sat Charles and Linda,<br />
And talked discursively, till Linda's thoughts,<br />
Inclining now to memory, now to hope,<br />
Vibrating from the future to the past,<br />
Took, in a silent mood, this rhythmic form.<br />

"Truly, Miss Percival, you puzzle me,"<br />
Said Charles, upon her silent revery<br />
Breaking abruptly in: "ay, you could fire<br />
And wound the villain bearing off the child,<br />
And you can brave the radical extreme<br />
On this great woman question of the day,&mdash;<br />
Yet do you seem a very woman still,<br />
And not at all like any man I know,&mdash;<br />
Not even like an undeveloped man!<br />
And I'm not greatly exercised by fear,<br />
Leaning here by your side thus lazily."<br />
"Don't mock me now," said Linda; "I'm not armed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span><br />
Be generous, therefore, in your raillery."<br />
"Not armed? Then will I venture to propose<br />
That when the tide is low this afternoon<br />
We try the beach on horseback. Will you venture?"<br />
The joy that sparkled in her eyes said "Yes"<br />
Before her tongue could duplicate assent.<br />
Said Charles, "I'll bring the horses round at six."<br />
"I will be ready, Mr. Lothian."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
There was no breach of punctuality:<br />
Though sighs, from deeper founts than tears, were heaved,<br />
When she drew forth the summer riding-habit<br />
Worn last when in the saddle with her father.<br />
"Here are the horses at the door!" cried Rachel;<br />
"A bay horse and a black; the bay is yours."<br />
When they were mounted, Lothian remarked:<br />
"Little Good Harbor Beach shall be our point;<br />
So called because an Indian once pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span><br />
The harbor 'little good,' meaning 'quite bad';<br />
A broad and open beach, from which you see<br />
Running out southerly the ocean side<br />
Of Eastern Point; its lofty landward end<br />
Gray with huge cliffs. There shall you mark 'Bass Rock,'<br />
Rare outlook when a storm-wind from the east<br />
Hurls the Atlantic up the craggy heights."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
The air was genial, and a rapid trot<br />
Soon brought them to the beach. The ebb had left<br />
A level stretch of sand, wide, smooth, and hard,<br />
With not a hoof-mark on the glistening plain.<br />
The horses tossed their heads with snorting pride,<br />
Feeling the ocean breeze, as curved and fell<br />
Up the long line the creeping fringe of foam,<br />
Then backward slid in undulating glass,<br />
While all the west in Tyrian splendor flamed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span><br />
"But this is life!" cried Linda, as she put<br />
Her horse to all his speed, and shook her whip.<br />
They skimmed the sand, they chased the flying wave,<br />
They walked their horses slow along the beach:<br />
And, as the light fell on a far-off sail,<br />
And made it a white glory to the eye,<br />
Said Linda: "See! it fades into the gray,<br />
And now 'tis dim, and now is seen no more!<br />
Yet would a little height reveal it still.<br />
So fade from memory scenes which higher points<br />
Of vision shall reveal: the beautiful,<br />
The good, shall never die; and so to-day<br />
Shall be a lasting, everlasting joy!"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"Would I might see more of such days!" said he,<br />
"In the obscure before me! Fate forbids.<br />
My time of idlesse terminates to-night.<br />
To-morrow to the city we return.<br />
Thither I go, to open, in October,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span><br />
A private school; and I must find a house<br />
And make my preparations."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">On they rode,</span><br />
After these words, in silence for a mile<br />
Upon their homeward way. Then Lothian:<br />
"And what will your address be, in the city?"<br />
"I do not know, nor care," said Linda, switching<br />
Her horse's ear, to start a quicker trot.<br />
Another mile of silence! "Look!" cried he;<br />
"The lighthouse light salutes us!"&mdash;"Yes, I see."<br />
"Why do you go so fast?"&mdash;"I'll slacken speed<br />
If you desire it. There!" They breathed their horses;<br />
Then Lothian: "Indeed, I hope that we<br />
Shall meet again."&mdash;"Why not? The world is wide,<br />
But I have known a letter in a bottle,<br />
Flung over in mid-ocean, to be found<br />
And reach its owner. Doubtless, we may meet."<br />
"I'm glad to find you confident of that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><br />
Silence again! And so they rode along<br />
Till they saw Rachel coming from the house<br />
To greet them. Charles helped Linda to dismount,<br />
Held out his hand, and said, "Good by, Miss Linda."<br />
"Good by!" she cheerily answered; "bid your father<br />
Good by for me. And so you go indeed<br />
To-morrow?"&mdash;"Yes, we may not meet again."<br />
"Well; pleasant journey!"&mdash;"Thank you. Good by, Rachel."<br />
He rode away, leading her panting horse;<br />
And, when the trees concealed him, Linda rushed<br />
Up stairs, and locked the door, and wept awhile.
</div><div class="poem">
As, early the next morning, she looked forth<br />
On the blue ocean from the open window,<br />
"Now, then, for work!" she cried, and drew her palm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span><br />
Across her brow, as if to thrust away<br />
Thoughts that too perseveringly came back<br />
She heard a step. 'Tis he! "I hardly hoped,<br />
Miss Percival, to find you up so early:<br />
Good by, once more!"&mdash;"Good by! Don't miss the train."<br />
At this a shadow fell on Lothian's face,<br />
As with uplifted hat and thwarted smile,<br />
He turned away. Then off with hasty stride<br />
He walked and struck the bushes listlessly.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"What did I mean by speaking so?" said Linda,<br />
With hand outstretched, as if to draw him back.<br />
"Poor fellow! He looked sad; but why&mdash;but why<br />
Is he so undemonstrative? And why<br />
Could he not ask again for my address,<br />
I'd like to know?" Poor Linda! She could preach,<br />
But, like her elders, could not always practise.<br />

It is the heart makes music musical!<br />
My neighbor has a mocking-bird: its song<br />
Has been as little heeded as the noise<br />
Of rattling wheels incessant; but to-day<br />
One of its strains brought all Elysium back<br />
Into my heart. What was it? What the tie<br />
Linking it with some inexpressive joy?<br />
At length I solve the mystery! Those notes,<br />
Pensively slow and sadly exquisite,<br />
Were what the wood-thrush piped at early dawn<br />
After that evening passage in the boat,<br />
When stars came out, that never more shall set.<br />
Oh! sweet and clear the measured cadence fell<br />
Upon my ear in slumber&mdash;and I woke!<br />
I woke, and listened while the first faint flush<br />
Of day was in the east; while yet the grove<br />
Showed only purple gloom, and on the beach<br />
The tidal waves with intermittent rush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span><br />
Broke lazily and lent their mingling chime.<br />
And O the unreckoned riches of the soul!<br />
The possible beatitudes, of which<br />
A glimpse is given, a transitory glimpse,<br />
So rarely in a lifetime! Then it was,<br />
Hearing that strain, as if all joy the Past<br />
Had in its keeping,&mdash;all the Future held,&mdash;<br />
All love, all adoration, and all beauty,&mdash;<br />
Made for a moment the soul's atmosphere,<br />
And lifted it to bliss unspeakable.<br />
O splendor fugitive! O transport rare!<br />
Transfiguring and glorifying life!<br />

This strange, inexplicable human heart!<br />
My lawyer sends me more good news; he writes:<br />
"The picture's sale will reach ten thousand copies,<br />
And for the first year only! We shall have<br />
A big bill to send in; and do not fear<br />
But the 'old man' will pay it, every dime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span><br />
To escape the heavy damages the law<br />
Allows for such infringement, he'll be glad<br />
To compromise for the amount I fix;<br />
And what I shall compel him to disgorge<br />
Will simply be fair copyright on all<br />
Your published works; and this will give you clear<br />
Some fifteen thousand dollars, not to speak<br />
Of a fixed interest in future sales."<br />
So writes my lawyer. Now one would suppose<br />
That news like this would make me light of heart,<br />
Spur my ambition; and, as taste of blood<br />
Fires the pet tiger, even so touch of gold<br />
Would rouse the sacred appetite of gain.<br />
But with attainment cometh apathy;<br />
And I was somewhat happier, methinks,<br />
When life was all a struggle, and the prayer,<br />
"Give me my daily bread," had anxious meaning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span><br />

Is it then true that woman's proper sphere<br />
Is in the affections? that she's out of place<br />
When these are balked, and science, art, or trade<br />
Has won the dedication of her thought?<br />
Nay! the affections are for all; and he,<br />
Or she, has most of life, who has them most.<br />
O, not an attribute of sex are they!<br />
Heart loneliness is loneliness indeed,<br />
But not for woman any more than man,<br />

Could have a worthy aim.<br />

Sees not in life the beauty till it sees<br />
God and the life beyond; not in a dream<br />

In all is lost, diluted, and absorbed,<br />

Vanish like smoke forever; but all real,<br />
Distinct, and individual, though all<br />
Eternally dependent on the One!<br />

Who gave the Heart to feel, shall He not love?<br />

A syllable or two, and thirst for more:<br />
Is there not One, Teacher at once and Cause,<br />
Who comprehends all beauty and all science,<br />
Holding infinity, that, step by step,<br />
We may advance, and find, in what seems good<br />
To Him, our gladness and our being's crown?<br />

Two vases, filled with flowers, upon a slab.<br />

Whom should I meet to-day but Meredith!<br />
My washerwoman, Ellen Blount, is ill,<br />
So ill I fear she never will be well.<br />
'Tis the old story, every day renewed:<br />
A little humble, tender-hearted woman,<br />
Tied to a husband whom to call a brute<br />
Would be to vilify the quadrupeds!<br />
A fellow, who must have his pipe, his whiskey,<br />
And his good dinner, let what may befall<br />
His wife and children. He could take the pittance<br />
She got from her hard toil, and spend it on<br />
Himself and his companions of the jug.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span><br />
When out of work, as he would often be,<br />
Then double toil for her! with peevish words<br />
From him, the sole requital of it all!<br />
Child after child she bore him; but, compelled<br />
Too quickly after childbirth to return<br />
To the old wash-tub, all her sufferings<br />
Reacted on the children, and they died,<br />
Haply in infancy the most of them,&mdash;<br />
Until but one was left,&mdash;a little boy,<br />
Puny and pale, gentle and uncomplaining,<br />
With all the mother staring from his eyes<br />
In hollow, anxious, pitiful appeal.<br />
In this one relic all her love and hope<br />
And all that made her life endurable<br />
At length were centred. She had saved a dollar<br />
To buy for him a pair of overshoes;<br />
But, as she went to get them, Blount waylaid her,<br />
Learnt that she had the money, forced it from her.<br />
Poor Teddy had to go without his shoes.<br />
'Twas when the January thaw had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span><br />
The streets a-reek with mud and melting snow.<br />
Poor Teddy wet his feet, took cold, and died.<br />
"Come soon, mamma," were his last feeble words.<br />
Blount was a cunning ruffian; well he knew<br />
How far to go, and where and when to pause.<br />
Fluent and specious with his tongue, he kept,<br />
In his small sphere, a certain show of credit;<br />
And he could blow in tune for mother church,<br />
Though few the pennies he himself would give her.<br />
"Cast off the wretch," was my advice to Ellen.<br />
She loved him not; she might as well have tried<br />
To love a load that galled and wearied her.<br />
But custom, social fear, and, above all,<br />
Those sacramental manacles the church<br />
Had bound her in, and to the end would keep,<br />
Forbade the poor, scared, helpless little woman<br />
To free herself, by one condign resolve,<br />
From the foul incubus that sucked her life.<br />
So a false sense of duty kept her tied,<br />
Feeding in him all that was pitiless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span><br />
And now she's dying. I had gone to-day<br />
To take some little dainties, cream and fruit,<br />
And there, administering consolation,<br />
Was Meredith.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hearing his tones of faith,</span><br />
Seeing his saintly look of sympathy,<br />
I felt, there being between us no dissent<br />

And so I knelt and listened to his prayer.<br />
At length he noticed me, and recognized.<br />
"Miss Percival!" he cried; "can this be you?<br />
But when and why did you return from England?"<br />
"I've never been in England, never been<br />
Out of my native country," I replied.<br />
"But that is unaccountable," said he;<br />
"For I've seen letters, written as from you,<br />
Signed with your name, acknowledging receipts<br />
Of certain sums of money, dated London."<br />
"No money have I had but what I've earned,"<br />
Was my reply; "and who should send me money?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span><br />
Said he: "I have a carriage at the door;<br />
I would learn more of this; you'll not object<br />
To take a seat with me? Thank you; that's right."

Leaving the patient in good hands, we went,<br />
And through the noisy streets drove to the Park.<br />
Then all I'd ever known about my parents<br />
He drew from me; and all my history<br />
Since I had parted from him; noted down<br />
Carefully my address, and gave me his.<br />
Then to my lodgings driving with me back,<br />

Son of Queen Moonbeam by King Will-o'-the wisp&mdash;<br />
Appears, and jumping from his gilded boat,<br />
Lays heart and fortune at my idle feet!<br />
Ye languid day-dreams, vanish! let me act!<br />

But ah! Fastidio says, "A woman's wooing<br />
Must always be offensive to a man<br />
Of any dignity." The dignity<br />
That modest truth can shock is far too frail<br />
And sensitive to mate with love of mine,<br />
Whose earnestness might crush the feeble hand<br />
Linked in its own. So good by, dignity!<br />
I shall survive the chill of your repulse.<br />
Defiance, not of Nature's law, but Custom's,<br />
Is what disturbs Fastidio. Does he think<br />
That a <i>man's</i> wooing never is offensive<br />
To <i>woman's</i> dignity? In either sex<br />
The disaffection is not prompted by<br />
The wooing but the wooer; love can never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span><br />
Be an unwelcome tribute to the lover;<br />
Though freedom premature, or forwardness<br />
Unwarranted, may rightly fail to win.<br />
And so I'll run my risk; for I confess&mdash;<br />
(Keep the unuttered secret, sacred leaf!)&mdash;<br />
That there is one whom I could love&mdash;could die for,<br />
Would he but&mdash;Tears? Well, tears may come from strength<br />
As well as weakness: I'll not grudge him these;<br />
I'll not despair while I can shed a tear.<br />

I've found him&mdash;seen him! The Directory<br />
Gave me his residence. He keeps a school,<br />
One for young ladies only; and at once<br />
My coward heart hit on a good excuse<br />
For calling on him: Would he take a pupil?<br />
Rachel, my prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Of course he would.<br />
A flush of tender, joyful wonderment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span><br />
Methought, illumed his face at seeing me;<br />
Then, as it faded, I was grieved to mark<br />
How pale and thin and worn with care he looked.<br />
I took my leave, promising to return<br />
Within a week; and on the outer steps<br />
I met his father. "Turn and walk with me<br />
A square or two," said I; and he complied.<br />
"What ails him?" I inquired. "Only hard work:<br />
He puts too much of conscience into it.<br />
Needs help, but shrinks from debt, and so keeps on<br />
Doing the labor two or three should share.<br />
What shall I do, Miss Percival, to stop it?"<br />
"I know not,&mdash;only something must be done,<br />
And that at once," said I, in tones which made<br />
The old man turn to get a look at me.<br />
I hailed an omnibus, and there we parted....<br />
What if I write Charles Lothian a letter?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span><br />
Nay, I'll not skulk behind a sheet of paper,<br />
But face to face say what I have to say.<br />
This very evening must I call again.<br />
Let a firm will bear up my fainting heart!<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">X.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem">
And so at eight o'clock the carriage came,<br />
And entering it I drove to Lothian's.<br />
At last I was alone with him once more!<br />
He had been sitting at a table heaped<br />
With manuscripts, and these he was correcting.<br />
"I'm here to interrupt all this," said I;<br />
"Too long you've kept your brain upon the stretch:<br />
Why be so heedless of your health, your life?"<br />
"But what are they to you, Miss Percival?"<br />
"And that is what I've come to let you know,"<br />
Said I, emboldened by the offered foothold.<br />
He flushed a little, only just a little,&mdash;<br />
Replying, "<i>That</i> I'm curious to learn."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span><br />
And then, like one who, in the dark, at first<br />
Moves cautiously, but soon runs boldly on,<br />
I said: "Rash gambler that I am, I've come<br />
To put upon the hazard of a die<br />
Much of my present and my future peace;<br />
Perhaps to shock, repel, and anger you,<br />
Since 'twill not be unwarned that I offend.<br />
I know you guess my purpose, and you shrink<br />
From hearing me avow it; but I will,<br />
And that in homely English unadorned.<br />
I'm here to offer you my hand; the heart<br />
That should go with it has preceded it,<br />
And dwells with you, so you can claim your own,<br />
Or gently bid it go, to trouble you<br />
Never again. If 'tis unwomanly<br />
This to avow, then I'm unlike my sex,<br />
Not false to my own nature,&mdash;ah! not false.<br />
I must be true or die; I cannot play<br />
A masker's part, disguising hopes that cling<br />
Nearest my brooding heart. But, say the word,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span><br />
'I cannot love you,' and the bird who leaves<br />
The cage where he has pined will sooner try<br />
To enter it again, than I return<br />
To utter plaint of mine within your hearing."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
With throbbing heart and burning face I ceased.<br />
Twice, thrice he tried to stop me; but my words<br />
Came all too quick and earnestly for that.<br />
And then resigned he listened. I had seen,<br />
Or dreamed I had, at first a sacred joy<br />
At my avowal sparkle in his eyes,<br />
And then an utter sadness follow it,<br />
Which chilled me, and I knew that I had failed.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"O divine Pity! what will you not brave?"<br />
He answered, and the dew was in his eyes,&mdash;<br />
"You bring her here, even to abase herself<br />
To rescue me! Too costly sacrifice!<br />
Here do not dwell the Graces and the Loves,<br />
But Drudgery is master of the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span><br />
Dear lady, elsewhere seek the answering bloom."<br />
A hope flashed up. "Do you suppose," said I,<br />
"That any impulse less supreme than love&mdash;<br />
Love bold to venture, but intemerate&mdash;<br />
Could bring me here&mdash;that Pity could do this?"<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"I believe all," he answered, "all you say;<br />
But do not bid me whisper more than this:<br />
The circumstances that environ me,<br />
And which none know,&mdash;not even my father knows,&mdash;<br />
Shut me out utterly from any hope<br />
Of marriage or of love. A wretch in prison<br />
Might better dream of marrying than I.<br />
But O sweet lady! rashly generous,&mdash;<br />
Around whom, a protecting atmosphere,<br />
Floats Purity, and sends her messengers<br />
With flaming swords to guard each avenue<br />
From thoughts unholy and approaches base,&mdash;<br />
Thou who hast made an act I deemed uncomely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span><br />
Seem beautiful and gracious,&mdash;do not doubt<br />
My memory of thy worth shall be the same,<br />
Only expanded, lifted up, and touched<br />
With light as dear as sunset radiance<br />
To summer trees after a thunder-storm."<br />
</div><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
And there was silence then between us two.<br />
Thought of myself was lost in thought for him.<br />
What was my wreck of joy, compared with his?<br />
Health, youth, and competence were mine, and he<br />
Was staking all of his to save another.<br />
If my winged hopes fell fluttering to the ground,<br />
Regrets and disappointments were forgotten<br />
In the reflection, He, then, is unhappy!<br />
"Good by!" at length I said, giving my hand:<br />
"Even as I was believed, will I believe.<br />
You do not deal in hollow compliment;<br />
And we shall meet again if you're content.<br />
The good time will return&mdash;and I'll return!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span><br />
"If you return, the good time will return<br />
And stay as long as you remain," said he.<br />

It is as I supposed: an obstacle<br />
Which his assumption of his father's debts<br />
Has raised before him unexpectedly!<br />
I did not let a day go by before<br />
I saw the elder Lothian, and he,<br />
Distressed by what I told him of a secret,<br />
Applied himself to hunting up a key<br />
To the mysterious grief: at last he got it,<br />
Though not by means that I could justify.<br />
In Charles's private escritoire he found<br />
A memorandum that explained it all.<br />
Among the obligations overlooked,<br />
In settling up the firm's accounts, was one<br />
Of fifty thousand dollars, payable<br />
To an estate, the representatives<br />
Of which were six small children and a widow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span><br />
Dependent now on what they could derive<br />
Of income from this debt; and manfully<br />
Charles shoulders it, although it crushes him;<br />
And hopes to keep his father ignorant.<br />
I can command one quarter of the sum<br />
Already&mdash;but the rest? That staggers me.<br />
And yet why should I falter? Look at <i>him</i>!<br />
Let his example be my high incentive.<br />
I'll be his helpmate, and he shall not know it.<br />
Poor Charles! I'll toil for him,&mdash;to him devote<br />
All that I have of energy and skill,<br />
All I acquire. Ambition shall not mount<br />

Come forth, my easel! All thy work has been<br />
Girl's play till now; now will I truly venture.<br />
I've a new object now&mdash;to rescue <i>him</i>!<br />

Among my hearers lately there has been<br />
A lady all attention to my words:<br />
Thrice have I seen that she was deeply moved;<br />
And to confession yesterday she came.<br />
Let me here call her Harriet. She is<br />
By education Protestant, but wavers,<br />
Feeling the ground beneath her insecure,<br />
And would be led unto the rock that is<br />
Higher than she. A valuable convert;<br />
Not young; in feeble health; taxed for two millions;<br />
And she would found, out of her ample means,<br />
A home for orphans and neglected children.<br />
Heaven give me power to lead the stray one safe<br />
Into the only fold; securing thus<br />
Aid for the church, salvation for herself!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><br />

<span class="pnum2">III.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
A summons took me to her house to-day.<br />
Her mother and her step-father compose<br />
With Harriet the household. I refrain<br />
From putting real names on paper here.<br />
Let me then call the man's name, Denison;<br />
He's somewhat younger than his wife, a lady<br />
Advanced in years, but her heart wholly set<br />
On the frivolities of fashion still.<br />
I see the situation at a glance:<br />
A mercenary marriage on the part<br />
Of Denison, whose hungry eyes are fixed<br />
Upon the daughter's property; the mother<br />
Under his evil influence, and expecting<br />
The daughter to die soon, without a will,<br />
Thus leaving all to them;&mdash;and Harriet<br />
Not quite so dull but she can penetrate<br />
Denison's motive and her mother's hope!<br />
A sad state for an invalid who feels<br />
That any hour may be her last! To-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span><br />
Harriet confessed; for she has been alarmed<br />
By some bad symptoms lately. As she urged it,<br />
I sent word to the bishop, and he came,<br />
And she was formally confirmed, and taken<br />
Unto the bosom of the Church, and there<br />
May her poor toiling spirit find repose!<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">IV.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
Another summons! In the drawing-room,<br />
Whom should I meet but Denison? His stare<br />
Had something vicious in it; but we bowed,<br />
And he remarked: "I hear that Harriet,<br />
Caught in your Catholic net, is turning saint.<br />
No foul play, priest! She's not in a condition<br />
To make a will, or give away her money.<br />
Remember that, and do not waste your words."<br />
My color rose, and the brute Adam in me<br />
Would, uncontrolled, have surely knocked him down.<br />
But I cast off temptation, and replied:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span><br />
"Sir, I'm responsible to God, not man."<br />
I left him, and passed on to Harriet.<br />
I found her greatly moved; an interview<br />
She had been having with her mother caused<br />
The agitation. "Take me hence!" she cried;<br />
"I'll not remain another day or hour<br />
Under this roof. I tell you, I'm not safe<br />
With these two, watching, dogging, maddening me."<br />
She rang the bell, and to the servant said:<br />
"My carriage, and that quickly!" Then to me:<br />
"I'll show them that I'm mistress of my fortune<br />
And of myself. Call on me in an hour<br />
At the Fifth Avenue Hotel, for there<br />
Henceforth I make my home." And there<br />
I called, as she had ordered, and we met<br />
In her own parlor. "What I wish," said she,<br />
"Is to give all I have, without reserve,<br />
For the foundation that I've planned. I'll send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span><br />
Directions to my lawyer, and the papers<br />
Shall be prepared at once."&mdash;"Before you do it,<br />
Let me learn more of you and yours," said I:<br />
"Who was your father?" Then, to my surprise,<br />
I learnt that he was one whom I had met<br />
Some years before,&mdash;in his death-hour had met.<br />
"But you've a sister?" suddenly I asked.<br />
Surprised, she answered: "A half-sister&mdash;yes&mdash;<br />
I've seen her only once; for many years<br />
I lived in Europe; she's in England now,<br />
And married happily. On three occasions<br />
I've sent her money."&mdash;"Do you correspond?"<br />
"Not often; here are letters from her, full<br />
Of thanks for all I've given her."&mdash;"In your will<br />
Shall you remember her?"&mdash;"If you advise it."<br />
"Then I advise a liberal bequest.<br />
And now I must attend a sufferer<br />
Who waits my help."&mdash;"Father, I would confess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span><br />
"Daughter, be quick: I listen." Harriet<br />
Then gave a sad recital of a trial<br />
And a divorce; and (but reluctantly)<br />
Told of a terrible suspicion, born<br />
Of a remark, dropped by a servant once,<br />
Concerning her unlikeness to her father:<br />
But never could she wring a confirmation<br />
Of the distressing story from her mother.<br />
"Tell her," said I, "you mean to leave your sister<br />
A handsome legacy." She promised this.<br />
Then saying I would call the following day,<br />
I hurried off to see poor Ellen Blount.<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">V.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
A new surprise! There, by the patient's bed,<br />
I came on Linda, Harriet's half-sister!<br />
(Reputed so, at least, but here's a doubt.)<br />
I questioned her, and now am satisfied<br />
Treason and forgery have been at work,<br />
Defeating Harriet's sisterly intent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span><br />
Moreover, that the harrowing surmise,<br />
Waked by a servant's gossip overheard,<br />
Is, in all probability, the truth!<br />
And, if we so accept it, what can I<br />
Advise but Harriet's complete surrender<br />
Of all her fortune to the real child<br />
And proper heir of Albert Percival?<br />
But ah! 'tis now devoted to the Church!<br />
Here's a divided duty; I must lay<br />
The case before a higher power than mine.<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">VI.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
I've had a long discussion with the bishop.<br />
I placed before him all the facts, beginning<br />
With those of my own presence at the death<br />
Of Linda's parents; of her father's letter<br />
Received that day, communicating news<br />
Of Kenrick's large bequest; the father's effort<br />
In dying to convey in legal form<br />
To his child Linda all this property;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span><br />
The failure of the effort; his decease,<br />
And all I knew of subsequent events.<br />
And the good bishop, after careful thought,<br />
Replied: "Some way the mother must be brought<br />
To full confession. Of her guilt no doubt!"<br />
I told him I had charged it on the daughter<br />
To tell her mother of the legacy<br />
Designed for Linda; this, perchance, might wring<br />
Confession from the guilty one. He seemed<br />
To think it not unlikely, and remarked:<br />
"When that is got, there's but a single course<br />
For you to urge on Harriet; for, my son,<br />
I need not tell a Christian gentleman,<br />
Not to say priest, that this peculiar case<br />
We must decide precisely as we would<br />
If the Church had in it no interest:<br />
Let Harriet at once give up, convey,<br />
Not bequeathe merely, all she has to Linda.<br />
Till she does this, her soul will be in peril;<br />
When she does this, she shall be made the ward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span><br />
Of Holy Church, and cared for to the end."<br />
I kissed his hand and left. How his high thoughts<br />
Poured round my path a flood of light divine!<br />
Why did I hesitate, since he could make<br />
The path of duty so directly clear!<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">VII.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem">
Harriet's intimation to her mother<br />
That she should leave a good part of her wealth<br />
To her half-sister brought things to a crisis.<br />
To-day my visit found the two together:<br />
Harriet, in an agony of tears,<br />
Cried to me, as I entered,&mdash;"'Tis all true!<br />
God! She confesses it&mdash;confesses it!<br />
Confesses, too, she never sent the money,<br />
And that the letters were all forgeries!<br />
And thinks, by this confession, to secure<br />
My fortune to herself! Ah! Can this woman<br />
Be, then, my mother?"<br />
</div><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Hereupon the woman,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span><br />
Crimson with rage at being thus exposed,<br />
Exclaimed, "Unnatural daughter&mdash;" But before<br />
Her wrath could vent itself, she, with a groan,<br />
Fell in convulsions. Medical assistance<br />
Was had at once. Then Denison came in,<br />
Aghast at what had happened; for he knew<br />
His wife's estate was all in lands and houses,<br />
And would, if she should die, be Harriet's,<br />
Since the old lady superstitiously<br />
Had still put off the making of a will.<br />
All help was vain, and drugs were powerless.<br />
Paralysis had struck the heated brain,<br />
Driving from mortal hold the consciousness:<br />
It reappeared not in one outward sign,<br />
And before midnight life had left the clay.
</div>

<span class="pnum2">VIII.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
Meek and submissive as a little child<br />
Is Harriet now; she has no will but that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span><br />
The Church imposes as the will divine.<br />
"Your fortune, nearly doubled by this death,<br />
Must all," said I, "be now conveyed to Linda."<br />
"Let it be done," she cried, "before I sleep!"<br />
And it was done to-night&mdash;securely done,&mdash;<br />
I being Linda's representative.<br />
To-morrow I must take her the good news.<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">IX.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
After the storm, the rainbow, child of light!<br />
Such the transition, as I pass to Linda!<br />
I found her hard at work upon a picture.<br />
With wonder at Heaven's ways she heard my news.<br />
Shocked at the tragic death, she did not hide<br />
Her satisfaction at the tardy act<br />
Bringing the restitution of her own.<br />
Three things she asked; one was that I would place<br />
At once a certain person in possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><br />
Of a large sum, not letting him find out<br />
From whom it came; another was to have<br />
This great change in her fortunes kept a secret<br />
As long as she might wish; the third and last<br />
Was that she might be privileged to wait<br />
On Harriet with a sister's loving care.<br />
All which I promised readily should be,<br />
So far as my poor human will could order.<br />
Said Linda then: "Tell Harriet, her scheme<br />
For others' welfare shall not wholly fail;<br />
That in your hands I'll place a sum sufficient<br />
To plant the <i>germ</i> at least of what she planned."<br />
</div>

<span class="pnum2">X.</span><br />
<br /><div class="poem">
I've taken my last look of Harriet:<br />
She died in Linda's arms, and comforted<br />
With all the Church could give of heavenly hope.<br />
Slowly and imperceptibly does Time<br />
Work out the dreadful problem of our sins!<br />
Not often do we see it solved as here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span><br />
In plain results which he who runs may read.<br />
Not always is the sinner's punishment<br />
Shown in this world. May the Eternal Mercy<br />
Cleanse us from secret faults, nor, while we mark<br />
Another's foulness, blind us to our own!<br />

In tones not unfamiliar to our ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span><br />
And there, six boats swept by, from which the voices<br />
Of merry children and their elder friends&mdash;<br />
Mothers and fathers, teachers, faded aunts,<br />
Dyspeptic uncles, wonderfully cured<br />
All by this tonic, Adirondack air&mdash;<br />
Came musical and loud: a strange collection,<br />
Winnowed by Rachel (now the important queen<br />
Of all this sanitary revelry)<br />
From her acquaintance in the public schools;<br />
Whence her quick sympathies had carried her<br />
Straight to the overworked, the poor, the ailing,<br />
Among the families of her associates,<br />
When Linda planned this happy enterprise<br />
Of a grand camping-out for one whole month.<br />
The blind aunt and the grandmother, of course,<br />
High and important persons, Rachel's aids,<br />
Graced the occasion; for the ancient dame<br />
Had lived in such a region in her youth,<br />
And in all sylvan craft was proudly wise:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span><br />
Declaring that this taste of life would add<br />
Some ten years to her eighty-five, at least.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
On went the boats, all large and safely manned,<br />
In competition not too venturesome.<br />
Then, from a rocky outlook on the hill,<br />
There came a gush of music from a band,<br />
Employed to cheer with timely melody<br />
This strange encampment in the wilderness.<br />
Hark! Every voice is hushed as down the lake<br />
The breathing clarions accordant send<br />
The tune of "Love Not" to each eager ear!<br />
The very infant, in its slumber, smiled<br />
As if a dream of some old paradise<br />
Had been awakened by the ravishment.<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"Look at the child!" cried Linda; "mark that smile!<br />
All heaven reflected in a dew-drop! See!"<br />
"And all the world grasped in that little fist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
At least as we esteem the world!" cried Charles.<br />
"And yet," said Linda, "'tis a glorious world:<br />
See how those families enjoy themselves!"<br />
"And who created all this happiness?"<br />
The husband said,&mdash;"who, after God, but Linda?<br />
Who spends her money, not in rearing piles<br />
Of cold and costly marble for her pride,&mdash;<br />
Not in great banquets for the rich and gay<br />
Who need them not, and laugh at those who give,&mdash;<br />
Where, at one feast, enough is spent to make<br />
All these poor people radiant for a month,&mdash;<br />
But in exhilarations coming from<br />
Communicated joy and health and life,&mdash;<br />
The happiness that's found in making happy."<br />
</div><div class="poem">
"All selfishness!" cried Linda; "selfishness!<br />
I seek my happiness, and others theirs;<br />

Where would have been the monarch of this joy,<br />
That little child,&mdash;that antepast of bliss<br />

"Ah! little wife," cried Charles, "I've half a mind<br />

Before we left the sea-side I had learnt,<br />
Through gossip of my worthy landlady,<br />
Where you would go, returning to New York.<br />
I found your house; I passed it more than once<br />
When, like a beacon, shone your study-lamp.<br />
The very night before you called upon me<br />
To ask, would I take Rachel as my pupil,<br />

I sought an anodyne for my despair<br />

"Ten days elapsed, and then from utter gloom<br />
I sprang to cheerful light. My father's partner,<br />

Why do you smile?"<br />

"That very day I cleared myself from debt;<br />

And so it would have been, if you, my dear,<br />
Had made no sign, and waited patiently.<br />
But ah! what luck was mine! After two days,<br />
The news arrived that Linda was an heiress.<br />
An heiress! Think of it; and I had said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span><br />
Never, no, never would I wed an heiress!<br />
But 'twas too late for scruples; I was married,&mdash;<br />
Caught in the trap I always meant to shun!"<br />

Then Linda, mischief in her smile, exclaimed:<br />

Was needless, since priority in love<br />
Was yours, and your intention would have brought<br />
The same result about without my seeking.<br />

I'd got the news of my recovered fortune;<br />
From me the money came, and only me;<br />
And all that story of a Judd, turned deacon,<br />

Said Lothian, snatching up the smiling wonder,<br />
And handing it, with kisses, to the mother:<br />

<div class="center">"<i>Oh! lacking love and best experience.</i>"</div>
<p>An extreme Materialism here comes to the support of a grim theology. In
his "Physiology and Pathology of the Mind," Dr. Maudsley says: "To talk
about the purity and innocence of a child's mind is a part of that
poetical idealism and willing hypocrisy by which man ignores realities
and delights to walk in a vain show." Such sweeping generalizations do
not inspire confidence in the writer's prudence. Christ was nearer the
truth when he said, concerning little children,&mdash;"Of such is the kingdom
of heaven."</p>

<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Few honorable outlooks for support,<br />
Excepting marriage.</i>"</div>

<p>Referring to the fact that in Massachusetts, during the ten years from
1859 to 1869, the increase of crime among women has been much greater
than among men, Miss Catherine Beecher remarks: "But turning from these
(the criminal class) to the daughters of the most wealthy class, those
who have generous and devoted aspirations also feel that for them, too,
there is no opening, no promotion, no career, except that of
marriage,&mdash;<i>and for this they are trained to feel that it is disgraceful
to seek. They have nothing to do but wait to be sought. Trained to
believe marriage their highest boon, they are disgraced for seeking it,
and must affect indifference.</i></p>

<p>"Meantime to do anything to earn their own independence is what father
and brothers would deem a disgrace to themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> and their family. For
women of high position to work for their livelihood, in most cases
custom decrees as disgraceful. And then, if cast down by poverty, they
have been trained to nothing that would earn a support, or, if by chance
they have some resource, all avenues for its employment are thronged
with needy applicants."</p>

<p>This is but a very mild statement of the social fictions under which
woman is now suffering in mind, body, and estate; but it is valuable as
coming from a witness who hopes that some less radical remedy than
female suffrage will be found for existing evils. If the remedy lies
with woman herself, as all admit, how can we expect her to act
efficiently until she is a modifying force in legislation?</p>

<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Unions, no priest, no church can sanctify.</i>"</div>

<p>"The most absurd notions," says J. A. St. John, "have prevailed on the
subject of matrimony. Marriage, it is said, is a divine institution,
therefore marriages are made in heaven; but the consequence does not at
all follow; the meaning of the former proposition simply being that God
originally ordained that men and women should be united in wedlock; but
that he determined what particular men and women should be united, every
day's experience proves to be false. It is admitted on all hands that
marriage is intended to confer happiness on those who wed. Now, if it be
found that marriage does not confer happiness on them, it is an
undoubted proof that they ought not to have been united, and that the
sooner they separate the better; but from accepting this doctrine some
persons are deterred by misrepresentations of scripture, others by views
of policy, and others again by an entire indifference to human
happiness. They regard men and women as mere animals, and, provided they
have children, and rear them, nothing more."</p>

<p>"It is incredible," says Milton, "how cold, how dull, and far from all
fellow-feeling we are, <i>without the spur of self-concernment</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Behold the world's ideal of a wife!</i>"</div>

<p>"All women," says John Stuart Mill, "are brought up from their very
earliest years in the belief that their ideal character is the very
opposite to that of man; not self-will and self-government by
self-control, but submission and yielding to the control of others....
What is now called the nature of women is an eminently artificial
thing,&mdash;the result of forced repression in some directions, unnatural
stimulation in others."</p>

<p>The cowardice that is looked upon as disgraceful in a man is regarded by
many as rather honorable than otherwise in a woman. False notions,
inherited from chivalrous times, and growing out of the state of
subjection in which woman has been bred, have generated this
inconsistency. The truth is that courage is honorable to both sexes; to
a Grace Darling and an Ida Lewis, a Madame Roland and a Florence
Nightingale, as well as to a Bayard and a Shaw, a Napoleon and a
Farragut.</p>

<div class="center">"<i>That moment should the intimate relations<br />
Of marriage end, and a release be found!</i>"</div>

<p>In the United States the action of certain State legislatures, in
increasing the facilities for divorce, has been a subject of alarm among
persons bred under the influences of a more conservative system. It
would be difficult to show as yet whether social morality is harmed or
helped by the increased freedom. Nothing can be more deceptive and
unsatisfactory than the statistics offered on both sides of the
question. It is generally admitted, we believe, that in those countries
where divorce is most difficult, the number of illegitimate births is
largest, and the reputation of married women is most questionable. In
the nature of things, much of the prevalent immorality being furtive and
clandestine, it is impossible to estimate the extent of the evils
growing out of illiberal laws in relation to matrimony. In any
legislation on the subject women should have a voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<br />
<div class="smcap"><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6">Page 80.</a></div>
<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Unlike the Church, I look on marriage as<br />
A civil contract, not a sacrament.</i>"</div>

<p>Kenrick here refers of course to the Catholic Church, whose theory of
marriage, namely, that it is a sacrament and indissoluble, when once
contracted according to the forms of the Church, still influences the
legislation and social prejudices of Protestant communities in respect
to their own religious forms of marriage. It was not till the twelfth
century, and under the auspices of Pope Innocent III., that divorce was
prohibited by the civil as well as the canon law. But it is only a
marriage between Catholics that is indissoluble under the Catholic
system. In the case of a marriage of Protestants, the tie is not
regarded as binding. A dissolution was actually granted in such a case
where one of the parties turned Catholic, in 1857, by the bishop of Rio
Janeiro, who pronounced an uncanonical marriage null and void. Modern
legislation in establishing the validity of civil marriages aimed a
severe blow at ecclesiastical privilege.</p>

<p>To Rome and not to the Bible we must go for all the authority we can
produce for denying that marriage is simply a civil contract. The form,
binding one man to one woman, had its origin outside of the Bible. Up to
the time of Charlemagne in the eighth century, polygamy and concubinage
were common among Christians and countenanced by the Church. Even Luther
seems to have had somewhat lax, though not unscriptural, notions on the
subject. When Philip, landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, wanted to take another
wife, and threatened to get a dispensation from the Pope for the
purpose, Luther convoked a synod, composed of six of his proselytes, who
declared that marriage is merely a civil contract; that they could find
no passage in the Holy Scriptures ordaining monogamy; and they
consequently signed a decree permitting Philip to take a second wife
without repudiating his first.</p>

<p>In that reconstruction of laws, threatened by the movement in behalf of
female suffrage, it is not probable that the patriarchal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> institution of
polygamy will be regarded otherwise than as debasing to both sexes; but
perhaps a greater latitude of divorce will be sought as not inconsistent
with public morality. Looking at the question abstractly, and apart from
all religious and social prejudice, it certainly seems the height of
cruelty and absurdity to compel parties to keep up the relations of man
and wife when one of them feels towards the other either a physical
repugnance or a moral dislike. The impediments often raised by our
courts in the way of divorce are gross relics of barbarism, and will be
abolished by a higher legislative morality.</p>

<p>"Whoso," says Milton, "prefers either matrimony or other ordinance
before the good of man and the plain exigence of charity, let him
profess Papist or Protestant or what he will, he is no better than a
pharisee, and understands not the gospel; whom, as a misinterpreter of
Christ, I openly protest against." And, in another passage, he rebukes
those who would rest "in the mere element of the text," as favoring "the
policy of the Devil to make that gracious ordinance (of marriage) become
insupportable, that what with men not daring to venture upon wedlock,
and what with men wearied out of it, all inordinate license might
abound."</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. St. John, editor of the Prose Works of Milton, remarks in
reference to the marriage law as it now stands in England:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Having been invented and established by men, it is calculated to bear
with extreme severity on women</i>, who are daily subjected to wrongs and
hardships which they would not endure, were the relief of divorce open
to them. Those who take a different view descant upon the encouragement
which would, they say, be given to immorality were divorce made easy.
But the contrary is the truth.</p>

<p>"It is in behalf of morals, and for the sake of imparting a higher tone
to the feelings of society, that the present unnatural system should be
abolished. Where, what Milton calls, an unconjugal mind exists, there
must be unconjugal manners; and to what these lead no one need be told.
Where marriage is indissoluble, people presume upon that fact to
transgress its laws,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> which they would not do were it legally
practicable to obtain immediate redress.</p>

<p>"However, there is a great indisposition in mankind to innovate in
legislation; and they had generally rather be miserable according to
rule than free and happy on a novel principle.... Whenever it clearly
appears that man and wife can no longer live together in peace and
harmony, their separation would be far more beneficial to themselves and
favorable to morals, than their compulsory union. Milton's notions of
married life are highly flattering to women, whom he evidently
contemplates as the equal companions of men."</p>

<div class="center">"<i>Give her the suffrage.</i>"</div>
<br />
<p>In one of his pamphlets in behalf of women's suffrage, Professor F. W.
Newman of England, a man of widest culture and noblest sympathies, and
always among the ablest and foremost in good works, remarks: "It is
useless to reply that women have not political knowledge. Hitherto they
have had little motive to acquire it. But how much of such knowledge
have those male voters had, whom, for two hundred years past, candidates
for the place of M. P. have made drunk in the tippling-houses? The
arguments used against female suffrage simply show that there is nothing
valid to be said. Women have, <i>prima facie</i>, the same right as men."</p>

<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Not by evading or profaning Nature</i>."</div>

<p>In his recent "History of European Morals," Mr. Lecky, referring to the
fact that the prevalent doctrine is, that the very highest interest of
society is not to stimulate but to restrain multiplication, diminishing
the number of marriages and of children, presents the following
comments:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In consequence of this belief, and of the many factitious wants that
accompany a luxurious civilization, a very large and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> increasing
proportion of women are left to make their way in life without any male
protector, and the difficulties they have to encounter through physical
weakness have been most unnaturally and most fearfully aggravated by
laws and customs which, resting on the old assumption that every woman
should be a wife, habitually deprive them of the pecuniary and
educational advantages of men, exclude them absolutely from very many of
the employments in which they might earn a subsistence, encumber their
course in others by a heartless ridicule or by a steady disapprobation,
and consign, in consequence, many thousands to the most extreme and
agonizing poverty, and perhaps a still larger number to the paths of
vice.</p>

<p>"At the same time a momentous revolution, the effects of which can as
yet be but imperfectly descried, has taken place in the chief spheres of
female industry that remain. The progress of machinery has destroyed its
domestic character. The distaff has fallen from the hand. The needle is
being rapidly superseded, and the work which, from the days of Homer to
the present century, was accomplished in the centre of the family, has
been transferred to the crowded manufactory."</p>

<p>The necessity of those reforms which many noble women are now urging
upon public attention is clearly set forth in eloquent facts like these.</p>

<br />
<div class="smcap"><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9">Page 198.</a></div>
<br />
<div class="center">"<i>Is against nature.</i>"</div>

<p>A curious instance of the temerity with which flagrant errors are
pressed into the service of criticism is presented in some remarks in
the <i>N. Y. Nation</i>. "There is probably," it says, "no incident of
woman's condition which is more clearly natural than her passivity in
all that relates to marriage. In waiting to be wooed, she not only
complies with one of the conventional proprieties, but obeys what
appears to be a law of sex, <i>not amongst human beings only, but among
all animals</i>."</p>

<p>These remarks have been adopted by many American journalists, and have
been accepted perhaps by many readers as settling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> the whole question
with scientific accuracy and force, so far as analogies drawn from the
habits of the lower animals can settle it. But if the critic, while
buttering his daily bread or putting cream into his daily coffee, had
acquainted himself with the habits of the useful animal to which he is
indebted, he would never have been guilty of so prodigious a blunder. So
far from passively "waiting to be wooed," the cow, when the sexual
impulse is awakened, will disturb the whole neighborhood by her
bellowings. Should the critic reply that this is because she is kept in
an unnatural state of restraint, such reply would add only additional
force to the contradiction of the argument which he would offer.</p>

<p>Other examples in abundance, in confutation of his assumption, could no
doubt be furnished. But even were that assumption true, we might
sometimes be led to rather awkward results if we were to take the habits
of the lower animals as authoritative. Certain animals have not
infrequently an eccentric habit of destroying their offspring. Some of
our Chinese brethren, borrowing a hint perhaps from the brute creation,
are said to think it no sin to kill such female children as they have no
use for. We hope that no enterprising critic will recommend such a
solution as this of the woman problem.</p>
